  "driving_question": "What is the true cost of incarceration in the United States and how does it affect different groups in society?",
  "short_background_context": "The United States has seen an unprecedented scale of incarceration over the past forty years, becoming the world leader in this aspect. While the $80 billion spent annually on corrections is frequently cited as the cost of incarceration, this figure considerably underestimates the true cost by ignoring important social costs. These include costs to incarcerated persons, families, children, and communities. This study estimates the annual economic burden of incarceration in the United States, assigning monetary values to twenty-three different costs, yielding an aggregate burden of one trillion dollars. This approaches 6% of gross domestic product and dwarfs the amount spent on corrections. More than half of the costs are borne by families, children, and community members who have committed no crime.",
