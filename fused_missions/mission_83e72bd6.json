  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on a question from the University of the State of New York REGENTS HIGH SCHOOL EXAMINATION in Algebra II. The question requires students to simplify a complex algebraic expression involving real numbers and imaginary units. The expression is given in the form (x + 2i)(3 - 2xi) + 2x^2i, where x is a real number and i is the imaginary unit. The goal is to express the result in the simplest a + bi form. This requires understanding and applying the rules of algebra and complex numbers, and demonstrating clear, logical reasoning.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Write the given expression in simplest a + bi form.",
    "Task 2: Explain the steps you took to simplify the expression.",
    "Task 3: Evaluate the expression for a given value of x and interpret the result in terms of real and imaginary parts."
