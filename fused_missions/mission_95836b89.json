  "driving_question": "What would be the projected economic and budgetary effects of Senator Elizabeth Warren's proposed wealth tax?",
  "short_background_context": "In 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed a wealth tax on high-net worth families. The tax would be 2 percent of net worth above $50 million and 6 percent of net worth above $1 billion. The Warren campaign estimated that this proposal would raise $3.75 trillion over ten years. Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) projects that the proposal would raise between $2.3 trillion and $2.7 trillion in additional revenue in the 10-year window 2021 - 2030 while reducing GDP in 2050 by about 1 to 2 percent, depending on how the money is spent.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze the PWBM's projections and explain how the proposed wealth tax would affect the GDP and the economy in 2050.",
    "Compare and contrast the Warren campaign's estimates with the PWBM's projections. Discuss possible reasons for any discrepancies.",
