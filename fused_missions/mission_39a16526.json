  "driving_question": "How can we apply the scoring criteria of AP Computer Science A to analyze and optimize the use of arrays and ArrayLists in coding?",
  "short_background_context": "In AP Computer Science A, a key area of focus is the use and manipulation of arrays and ArrayLists. Arrays and ArrayLists are fundamental data structures in programming that store elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. They are used to store collections of data, and are particularly useful when working with large sets of data. The College Board provides scoring guidelines for AP Computer Science A, which include penalties for certain mistakes in the use of arrays and ArrayLists. Understanding these scoring guidelines can help you optimize your use of these data structures and avoid common mistakes.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze the given AP Computer Science A scoring guidelines, focusing on the penalties related to arrays and ArrayLists. Identify and explain three common mistakes that result in penalties.",
    "Given the canonical solution for the 'isWordChain' and 'createList' methods, evaluate the code based on the scoring guidelines. Identify any potential penalties and explain why they would be assessed.",
    "Optimize the 'isWordChain' and 'createList' methods to avoid any identified penalties. Explain your changes and how they improve the code."

    "What are some common mistakes you might make when working with arrays and ArrayLists?",
    "How do the scoring guidelines penalize these mistakes?",
