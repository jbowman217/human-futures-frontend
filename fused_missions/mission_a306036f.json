  "driving_question": "How can we apply the principles of Algebra II to solve complex real-world problems and understand the scoring mechanism of the Regents Examination?",
  "short_background_context": "The University of the State of New York conducts the Regents High School Examination in Algebra II, which assesses students' understanding of algebraic concepts and their application. The examination is scored based on a systematic, consistent method, and the scores are converted to a scale score for final evaluation. In this mission, we will dive deep into the principles of Algebra II, solve complex problems, and understand the scoring mechanism of the Regents Examination.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze the scoring mechanism of the Regents Examination in Algebra II and discuss its implications.",
    "Solve complex algebraic problems that could appear in the Regents Examination.",
    "Create your own algebraic problems and scoring rubric, mirroring the Regents Examination style."
