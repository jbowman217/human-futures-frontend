  "driving_question": "How can we use mathematics to solve real-life problems in various fields such as agriculture, construction, and industry?",
  "short_background_context": "Mathematics is one of the oldest disciplines in the world and has been used to solve practical real-life problems in various fields. However, many students do not connect mathematics with their daily lives, leading to a lack of interest and understanding. This mission is based on a study that found project-based teaching with real-life applications can stimulate students' confidence in mathematics, enhance their understanding, and increase their interest. In this mission, you will apply mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios, helping you to see the relevance and importance of mathematics in everyday life.",
  "tasks": [
    "Identify a real-world problem in the field of your interest and propose a mathematical model to solve it.",
    "Use statistical methods to analyze a dataset related to your chosen problem and interpret the results.",
    "Present your findings in a report, explaining how your mathematical model can help solve the real-world problem."

    "What real-world problem are you interested in solving?",
    "What mathematical concepts do you think could be applied to this problem?",
    "What data might you need to solve this problem?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on how this project has changed your perspective on the relevance and utility of mathematics. What did you learn about the application of mathematics to real-world problems?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you chose this particular mathematical model?",
    "How did the data you analyzed support your model?",
    "What challenges did you face in applying mathematics to your chosen problem and how did you overcome them?"
