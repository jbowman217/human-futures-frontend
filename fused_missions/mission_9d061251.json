  "short_background_context": "Access to health care is a complex issue that impacts individuals and communities around the world. It is influenced by a variety of factors, including socioeconomic status, geography, and policy decisions. In this mission, students will explore the topic of health care access from multiple disciplinary perspectives, including economics, geometry, statistics, history, health, ethics, and algebra. This mission is inspired by the work of College Board and WE, organizations that are committed to promoting educational equity and empowering students to become compassionate leaders and active citizens.",
