  "short_background_context": "In mathematics, particularly in calculus, the concept of a series converging is a fundamental one. A series is said to converge if the sum of its terms approaches a certain finite limit. On the other hand, if the sum of the terms of a series does not approach a finite limit, the series is said to diverge. In this mission, we will explore the Maclaurin series and use various tests, such as the integral test and limit comparison test, to determine the convergence of a series. Understanding this concept can have significant implications in various fields, including economics, where series are used to model and predict economic behaviors.",
