  "driving_question": "How can we design an experiment to test the effectiveness of a new drug on acne severity?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will dive into the world of experimental design and statistical analysis. We will use a real-world scenario, where a new drug is being tested for its effectiveness on acne severity. The experiment involves 72 people who receive either the new drug or a placebo. The response variable is the improvement in acne severity. We will explore the key components of this experiment, understand the scoring guidelines, and analyze the factors affecting the improvement scores.",

    {
      "task": "Identify the treatments, experimental units, and response variable in the given scenario."

      "task": "Explain why it is important to include both the new drug and the placebo in the treatments."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you understand by 'treatments', 'experimental units', and 'response variable'?",
    "Why might it be important to include a placebo in a drug trial?",
    "What factors do you think could affect the improvement scores in this experiment?"

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your understanding of experimental design before and after this mission. What new insights have you gained? How would you apply these insights to design an experiment in a different context?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you elaborate on why the placebo is included in the treatments?",
    "Why is it important to specify the experimental units as individual people?",
    "What might be the implications if the response variable is not defined correctly?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by proposing a different scenario for an experiment, such as testing the effectiveness of a new teaching method on students' math scores. They would then identify the treatments, experimental units, and response variable in their scenario.",
