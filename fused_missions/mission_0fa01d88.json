  "driving_question": "How can we use the concepts of probability and sampling distributions to solve real-world problems?",
  "short_background_context": "In the AP Statistics exam, students are often asked to solve problems related to probability and sampling distributions. One such problem involves determining the probability of a randomly selected bottle of shampoo being underfilled. The amount of shampoo in a bottle follows a normal distribution with a mean of 0.6 liter and a standard deviation of 0.04 liter. The problem requires the students to calculate the probability that a randomly selected bottle is underfilled, i.e., it contains less than 0.5 liter of shampoo.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Identify the correct parameter values (mean and standard deviation) for the normal distribution of the amount of shampoo in a bottle.",
    "Task 2: Specify the correct event (boundary value and direction) consistent with the values reported in Task 1.",
    "Task 3: Calculate the correct probability of the event specified in Task 2."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you know about normal distribution?",
    "How can you calculate the probability of an event under a normal distribution?",
    "What is the significance of the mean and standard deviation in a normal distribution?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your understanding of the normal distribution and its parameters. How did these concepts help you solve the problem?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Consider the mean and standard deviation. How do these values influence the shape of the normal distribution?",
    "Think about the boundary value and direction. How do these factors affect the calculation of the probability?",
    "Reflect on the z-score formula. How does it help in calculating the probability of an event under a normal distribution?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students could remix the problem by changing the mean and standard deviation values, or by changing the event (e.g., calculating the probability of a bottle being overfilled).",
  "display": {
    "graph_builder": "Students could use the graph builder to visualize the normal distribution and the event of interest.",
    "text_area": "Students could use the text area to write down their calculations and explanations."
