  "driving_question": "How can we analyze and understand the structure and content of the New York State Mathematics Test?",
  "short_background_context": "In 2013, the New York State began administering tests designed to assess student performance in accordance with the instructional shifts and rigor demanded by the new New York State P-12 Learning Standards in Mathematics. These tests include multiple-choice questions, short-response questions, and extended-response questions, each designed to assess different mathematical skills and concepts. The questions are often framed within real-world applications and require students to complete multiple steps. This mission is designed to help you understand and analyze these tests and the expectations for students.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze a set of multiple-choice questions from the test and identify the mathematical skills and concepts they are designed to assess.",
    "Review a set of short-response questions and explain how they require the application of multiple mathematical skills and real-world applications.",
    "Evaluate a set of extended-response questions and discuss how they assess student reasoning and the ability to critique the arguments of others."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What types of questions do you expect to see on the test?",
    "What mathematical skills and concepts do you think the test will assess?",
    "How do you think the test will incorporate real-world applications?"
