  "driving_question": "How can we model and interpret the density of a bacteria population in a circular petri dish?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will be analyzing the density of a bacteria population in a circular petri dish. The density is given by an increasing, differentiable function f, where f(r) is measured in milligrams per square centimeter. Values of f(r) for selected values of r are provided. We will use these values to estimate the rate of change of the bacteria population's density at a certain distance from the center of the petri dish, and also to approximate the total mass of bacteria in the dish. This mission requires a good understanding of algebra, statistics, and calculus concepts, as well as the ability to interpret and apply these concepts in a real-world context.",
