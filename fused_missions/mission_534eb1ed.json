  "short_background_context": "In 2023, the New York State Education Department (SED) administered Mathematics Tests and made approximately 75% of the questions available for review and use. The released questions are designed to help students, families, educators, and the public better understand the tests and the expectations for students. The questions are framed within real-world applications and often require students to complete multiple steps. They are linked to more than one standard, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills and concepts.",

    "Analyze the released questions and identify the skills and concepts they are designed to assess.",
    "Design a multiple-choice question that assesses standard algorithms and conceptual standards.",
