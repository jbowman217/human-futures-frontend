  "short_background_context": "Every year, the New York State Education Department administers Mathematics Tests for students in grades 3-8. These tests are designed to assess students' understanding of mathematical procedures, concepts, and applications. The test questions are often framed within real-world contexts and require students to complete multiple steps. The tests include multiple-choice questions, one-credit constructed-response questions, two-credit constructed-response questions, and three-credit constructed-response questions. Each type of question assesses different aspects of students' mathematical understanding and skills. Understanding the structure and expectations of these tests can help students prepare for them more effectively.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze a sample multiple-choice question from the New York State Mathematics Test. Identify what mathematical procedures and concepts it assesses.",
    "Analyze a sample one-credit constructed-response question from the test. Explain what skills it requires and how it is scored.",
    "Analyze a sample two-credit or three-credit constructed-response question from the test. Explain how it requires the application of multiple mathematical skills and real-world applications."
