  "driving_question": "How can we interpret and solve different types of questions from the New York State Mathematics Test?",
  "background_context": "The New York State Education Department administers Mathematics Tests yearly, releasing approximately 75% of the questions for review. These questions are designed to assess the New York State P\u201312 Next Generation Learning Standards for Mathematics. The questions are often framed within real-world applications and require students to apply multiple skills and concepts. There are multiple-choice questions, one-credit, two-credit, and three-credit constructed-response questions, each requiring different levels of understanding and application of mathematical procedures and concepts.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze a set of multiple-choice questions from the New York State Mathematics Test and identify the skills and concepts being assessed.",
    "Examine a one-credit constructed-response question, describe the steps needed to solve it, and provide the final answer.",
    "Choose a two-credit or three-credit constructed-response question, show your work in solving it, and explain the mathematical procedures and concepts applied."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What types of questions are you familiar with on the New York State Mathematics Test?",
    "What skills and concepts do you think are important for solving these questions?",
    "How do you approach solving a multi-step mathematics problem?"

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on the process of solving these questions. What strategies were most effective? What areas do you need to improve on?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you chose that approach to solve the problem?",
    "How does this concept apply to the problem?",
    "What other strategies could you have used to solve this question?"
