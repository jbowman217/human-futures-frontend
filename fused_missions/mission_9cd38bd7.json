  "driving_question": "How can algebraic expressions and calculus be used to model and analyze real-world scenarios such as vehicle arrivals at a toll plaza?",
  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on a sample question from the AP Calculus BC exam. The scenario involves a toll plaza where the rate of vehicle arrivals from 5 A.M. to 10 A.M. is given by a mathematical function. The function A(t) = 450 sin (0.62t) represents the rate of vehicle arrivals, where t is the number of hours after 5 A.M. and A(t) is measured in vehicles per hour. The traffic is flowing smoothly at 5 A.M. with no vehicles waiting in line.",
  "tasks": [
    "Write an integral expression that gives the total number of vehicles that arrive at the toll plaza from 6 A.M. (t = 1) to 10 A.M. (t = 5).",
    "Find the average value of the rate, in vehicles per hour, at which vehicles arrive at the toll plaza from 6 A.M. (t = 1) to 10 A.M. (t = 5).",
    "Analyze the impact of a change in the function A(t) on the total number of vehicles and the average rate of vehicle arrivals."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What does the function A(t) represent in this scenario?",
    "How can you use integral calculus to find the total number of vehicles that arrive at the toll plaza during a specific time period?",
    "How can you calculate the average rate of vehicle arrivals?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on how your understanding of algebra and calculus has deepened through this mission. How did these concepts help you analyze the given real-world scenario?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you chose that particular integral for the first task?",
    "What does the average value you calculated in the second task represent in the context of this scenario?",
    "How would a change in the function A(t) affect the total number of vehicles and the average rate of vehicle arrivals?"

  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by considering different functions for the rate of vehicle arrivals, or by considering different time intervals.",
