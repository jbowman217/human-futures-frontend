  "driving_question": "How can we apply the principles of AP Calculus to solve real-world problems in economics, geometry, statistics, history, ethics, and algebra?",
  "short_background_context": "Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and the accumulation of quantities. It is used in a wide array of disciplines including economics, engineering, physics, computer science, statistics, and many others. The AP Calculus course is designed to offer a deep understanding of calculus concepts, enabling students to apply these concepts in various real-world contexts. This mission is designed to explore the application of AP Calculus principles in the subjects of economics, geometry, statistics, history, ethics, and algebra.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Apply the principles of differentiation and integration to solve a problem in economics.",
    "Task 2: Use calculus to analyze a historical event or trend using statistical data.",
    "Task 3: Develop an ethical argument or solution to a problem using algebraic and calculus principles."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What are some real-world problems or situations where calculus might be useful?",
    "How might calculus principles be applied in the subjects of economics, geometry, statistics, history, ethics, and algebra?"

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on how your understanding of calculus has deepened through these tasks. How has applying calculus to these different subjects changed your perspective on its usefulness and application?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you think of other ways calculus could be applied to this problem?",
    "How might you approach this task differently if you were to do it again?",
    "What other mathematical principles could be useful in this context?"
