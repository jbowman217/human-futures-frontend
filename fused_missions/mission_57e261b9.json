  "short_background_context": "The Regents Examination in Algebra II is a comprehensive test that assesses students' understanding of various algebraic principles. It includes constructed-response questions that require students to apply their knowledge to solve problems and interpret the results. The exam is scored by a minimum of three mathematics teachers, with each teacher scoring approximately one-third of the constructed-response questions on a student's paper. The scores are then converted to a scale score using a conversion chart provided by the New York State Education Department. This mission will allow you to practice the skills necessary to succeed on this exam.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze a set of data and use algebraic principles to make predictions about future data points.",
    "Solve a complex real-world problem using algebraic equations and interpret the results.",
    "Create a geometric model that represents a real-world scenario and use algebra to solve for unknown variables."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What algebraic principles do you think will be most useful in solving these tasks?",
    "What strategies can you use to approach complex problems?",
    "How can you use algebra to make predictions about data?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "What did you learn from this mission? What strategies were most effective in solving the tasks? What areas do you need to improve on?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you used that particular algebraic principle?",
    "What other strategies could you have used to solve this problem?",
    "How does your solution relate to the real-world scenario?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by creating their own real-world scenarios to model with algebra. They could also adjust the complexity of the tasks to challenge themselves further.",
