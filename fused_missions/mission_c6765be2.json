  "background_context": "Mass incarceration is a pressing issue in our society, with a multitude of factors contributing to its prevalence. These factors range from economic disparities and climate change, to ethical considerations and health-related issues. This mission is based on the book 'Ending Mass Incarceration: Ideas from Today\u2019s Leaders' which features essays from various leaders proposing solutions to this problem. We will explore the issue through the lens of various subjects, including economics, climate, statistics, geometry, history, health, ethics, and algebra. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of mass incarceration and to brainstorm potential solutions.",
