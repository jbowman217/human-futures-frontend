  "short_background_context": "In the AP Computer Science A exam, the ability to design and implement a class is a crucial skill. The scoring guidelines provide insight into how points are awarded for specific components of a class, such as declaring a class header, constructor, and private instance variables. Understanding these guidelines can help you to design more effective classes and achieve higher scores on the exam. In this mission, you will explore a sample class 'Textbook' that extends another class 'Book', and delve into the scoring guidelines for this task.",
