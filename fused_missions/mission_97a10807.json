  "driving_question": "How can the Next Generation Science Standards be used to guide interdisciplinary learning in high school?",
  "short_background_context": "The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are a set of educational standards that aim to prepare students for college, career, and citizenship. They are based on the Framework for K-12 Science Education developed by the National Research Council. The NGSS are arranged by Disciplinary Core Ideas and by Topics, covering a wide range of subjects. As future citizens, it's crucial for students to understand these standards and how they guide their learning journey.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Analyze the structure of the Next Generation Science Standards and identify the core ideas and topics covered.",
    "Task 2: Choose one of the core ideas or topics from the NGSS and research how it is applied in real-world contexts.",
    "Task 3: Develop a project proposal that integrates at least three subjects listed above and aligns with the chosen core idea or topic from the NGSS."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you know about the Next Generation Science Standards?",
    "Why do you think these standards are important for your learning?",

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on how your understanding of the NGSS has evolved. How can these standards guide your future learning and career aspirations?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you elaborate on why you chose this particular core idea or topic?",
    "How does your project proposal align with the NGSS?",
    "What challenges did you face while integrating different subjects into your project proposal?"

  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by choosing different core ideas or topics from the NGSS, or by integrating additional subjects into their project proposal.",
