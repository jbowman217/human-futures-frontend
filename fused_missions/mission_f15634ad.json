This mission is based on the 'Standard' Personal Finance Curriculum developed by the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and St. Louis. It covers key aspects of personal finance such as decision-making, earning income, and buying goods and services. The mission integrates various subjects to provide a holistic understanding of personal finance. For example, you will use algebra and statistics to analyze financial data, apply ethical considerations to financial decisions, and use geometry to visualize financial trends.",
