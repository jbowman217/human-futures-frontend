  "driving_question": "How can we use public funds to stimulate wealth accrual for residents of low to moderate income communities while avoiding exclusionary gentrification?",
  "short_background_context": "The 21st century Homestead Act aims to counteract the longstanding legacy of racially discriminatory housing policies by revitalizing distressed communities through public investment. The basic structure of the program is a wholesale transfer of land to residents who meet certain criteria. This proposal would benefit people who live in select small and medium-sized cities that are experiencing high vacancies. Housing is a powerful lever that affects other aspects of inequality. For most Americans, their home is their largest asset, and for those who do not own a home, it is their greatest expense. This mission will explore the potential of this proposal and its implications.",
