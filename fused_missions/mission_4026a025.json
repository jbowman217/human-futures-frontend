  "driving_question": "How can we apply the New York State P-12 Learning Standards for Mathematics to real-world problems?",
  "short_background_context": "In 2013, New York State (NYS) began administering tests designed to assess student performance in accordance with the instructional shifts and rigor demanded by the new New York State P-12 Learning Standards in Mathematics. The tests are designed to measure students' understanding of standard algorithms and conceptual standards. The questions are often framed within the context of real-world applications and require students to complete multiple steps. In 2021, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the tests included previously administered questions and were used solely as a measure of student learning.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze and interpret a set of previously administered multiple-choice questions from the New York State Mathematics Test.",
    "Apply the New York State P-12 Learning Standards for Mathematics to solve a real-world problem.",
    "Create a new multiple-choice question that could be included in a future New York State Mathematics Test, ensuring it aligns with the P-12 Learning Standards and requires the application of multiple standards."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you already know about the New York State P-12 Learning Standards for Mathematics?",
    "How would you approach solving a real-world problem using these standards?",
    "What elements would you include in a multiple-choice question to ensure it aligns with the standards and is rigorous enough to be included in the state test?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your understanding of the New York State P-12 Learning Standards for Mathematics before and after this mission. How confident do you feel in applying these standards to real-world problems?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you chose that approach to solve the real-world problem?",
    "How does your multiple-choice question align with the P-12 Learning Standards?",
    "What other real-world scenarios could you apply these standards to?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by choosing a different state's mathematics standards to study and apply, or by creating a set of multiple-choice questions instead of just one.",
