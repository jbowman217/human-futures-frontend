  "driving_question": "How can we manipulate and analyze 2D arrays in computer science?",
  "short_background_context": "In computer science, arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store and manipulate collections of items. A 2D array, or two-dimensional array, is essentially an array of arrays. It can be visualized as a grid (like a chessboard), where each cell is an element that can store a value. In this mission, we'll explore the AP Computer Science A 2022 scoring guidelines for a problem involving 2D arrays. We'll delve into the tasks of repopulating a 2D array and counting increasing columns, using the provided canonical solution as a guide.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze the 'repopulate' function in the canonical solution. What is its purpose? What does it do to the 2D array?",
    "Study the 'countIncreasingCols' function. How does it traverse the 2D array? What does it return and why?",
    "Create your own 2D array and apply the 'repopulate' and 'countIncreasingCols' functions to it. What results do you get? Can you explain why?"
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you understand by a 2D array?",
    "How do you think a 2D array can be traversed?",
    "What could be the possible applications of 2D arrays?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your understanding of 2D arrays before and after this mission. What new insights have you gained? How can these insights be applied in different contexts?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why the 'repopulate' function uses a while loop inside the nested for loops?",
    "What would happen if the 'ordered' variable in the 'countIncreasingCols' function was not reset to true for each column?",
    "How would you modify the 'countIncreasingCols' function to count decreasing columns instead?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Try modifying the 'repopulate' function to populate the 2D array with different values. For example, you could try populating it with prime numbers, or numbers in a certain range. How does this change the output of the 'countIncreasingCols' function?",
