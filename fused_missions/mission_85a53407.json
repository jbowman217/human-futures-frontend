  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on the New York State Regents High School Examination for Algebra II. The examination tests students' understanding of Algebra II concepts and their application in different contexts. It includes multiple-choice questions and tasks that require students to apply algebraic formulas, interpret graphs, and analyze data. Students will need to use a graphing calculator and a straightedge (ruler) to complete some tasks. The examination emphasizes the importance of demonstrating the necessary steps to arrive at an answer, including appropriate formula substitutions, diagrams, graphs, charts, etc.",

    "Can you explain why you chose that type of study for the grocery store scenario?",
    "What features of the graph helped you determine where the function is positive?",
    "How did you substitute the values into the compound interest formula?"
