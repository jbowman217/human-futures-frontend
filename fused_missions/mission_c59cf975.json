  "driving_question": "How can we create a fair and effective grading system for programming assignments that encourages creativity and originality?",
  "short_background_context": "In programming, one problem can usually be solved using different logics and constructs but still producing the same output. Sometimes students get marked down inappropriately if their solutions do not follow the answer scheme. In addition, lab exercises and programming assignments are not necessary graded by the instructors but most of the time by the teaching assistants or lab demonstrators. This results in grading inconsistencies in terms of the marks awarded when the same solution is being graded by different person. To address this issue, a set of assessment rubric is necessary in order to provide flexibility for critical and creative solutions among students as well as to improve grading consistencies among instructors and teaching assistants or demonstrators.",
