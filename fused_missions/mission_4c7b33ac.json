  "driving_question": "How can we use arrays and ArrayLists in Java to manipulate and analyze data?",
  "short_background_context": "In the AP Computer Science A course, you'll learn about fundamental programming concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP) and data structures. In this mission, we will focus on arrays and ArrayLists, which are types of data structures in Java that can store multiple values. You'll be given sample student responses and scoring commentary from a previous AP test. Your task will be to understand the problem, analyze the solutions, and then apply your knowledge to similar problems. This will not only help you understand these important concepts better but also prepare you for the AP exam.",
