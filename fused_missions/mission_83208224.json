  "short_background_context": "Factoring is a key concept in algebra, statistics, and geometry, and forms the basis for many more complex mathematical operations. It involves breaking down an algebraic expression into its simplest factors or terms that, when multiplied together, give the original expression. This mission is based on a question from the Algebra II Regents High School Examination conducted by the University of the State of New York. The question requires students to factor a complex algebraic expression completely, demonstrating their understanding of algebraic operations and factoring techniques.",
