  "driving_question": "How can we use the concept of normal distribution to understand and predict the amount of gold applied to a necklace during production?",
  "short_background_context": "The College Board's AP Statistics exam includes an investigative task that requires students to understand and apply statistical concepts in real-world scenarios. One such task involves the production of gold necklaces. A machine applies a certain amount of gold to each necklace it produces, and this amount can be modeled using a normal distribution. The mean amount of gold applied is 300mg, with a standard deviation of 5mg. This task will guide you through understanding and applying this distribution to predict the likelihood of a necklace containing a certain amount of gold.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Graphically represent the normal distribution of the amount of gold applied to the necklaces. Include the mean and standard deviation on your graph.",
    "Task 2: Using the 'normalcdf' function, calculate the probability of a necklace containing between 296mg and 304mg of gold.",
    "Task 3: Provide a written explanation of your findings, including how you used the normal distribution and 'normalcdf' function to calculate the probability."

    "What does a normal distribution graph look like?",

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your understanding of normal distribution and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios. How confident do you feel in your ability to calculate probabilities using this distribution?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "What does the mean of 300mg represent in this context?",
    "Why is the standard deviation important in understanding the distribution?",
    "Can you explain how the 'normalcdf' function works?"

  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by considering different means and standard deviations, or by applying the concept to different real-world scenarios, such as the production of other types of jewelry or goods.",
