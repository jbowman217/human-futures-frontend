  "driving_question": "How can we use calculus to analyze and predict the temperature of coffee over time?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will explore an AP Calculus BC problem that involves the temperature of coffee in a cup. The temperature is modeled by a decreasing differentiable function C(t), with t representing time in minutes. We are given a table of times and corresponding temperatures. Using calculus, we will estimate the rate of temperature change, calculate the average temperature over a specific time interval, predict the temperature at a future time, and analyze the rate of change in the temperature.",

    "Approximate the value of C'(5) using the average rate of change of C over the interval 3\u2264t\u22647. Include correct units with your answer.",
    "Approximate the value of \u222b from 0 to 12 C(t) dt. Interpret your answer in the context of the problem.",
    "Given that for 12\u2264t\u226420, C'(t) = 0.01(24.55 - t)e^(-0.01t), predict the temperature of the coffee at time t=20."
