  "driving_question": "How can we apply the New York State P-12 Learning Standards for Mathematics to solve real-world problems?",
  "short_background_context": "In 2013, New York State began implementing tests designed to assess student performance in line with the instructional shifts and rigor demanded by the new New York State P-12 Learning Standards in Mathematics. These tests are designed to evaluate students' understanding of mathematical procedures, concepts, and applications, often within the context of real-world problems. The tests include multiple-choice questions, short-response questions, and extended-response questions, each requiring the application of multiple mathematical skills and concepts.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze and solve a set of multiple-choice questions designed to assess standard algorithms and conceptual standards.",
    "Complete a series of short-response tasks that require you to show your work and apply multiple mathematical skills.",
    "Answer an extended-response question that allows you to demonstrate your understanding of mathematical procedures, conceptual understanding, and application."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What mathematical concepts do you think you'll need to apply to solve these problems?",
    "How do you plan to approach the extended-response question?",
    "What strategies can you use to ensure you understand what each question is asking?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "What did you learn about your understanding of the New York State P-12 Learning Standards for Mathematics from completing this mission? What strategies were most effective for you?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you chose that approach to solve this problem?",
    "How does this concept apply to the real world?",
    "What other mathematical concepts could be used to solve this problem?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by creating their own multiple-choice, short-response, and extended-response questions based on the New York State P-12 Learning Standards for Mathematics.",
