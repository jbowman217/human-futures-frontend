  "short_background_context": "In this mission, you will be analyzing the traffic flow at a toll plaza. The rate at which vehicles arrive at the toll plaza is given by a function A(t) = 450 sin (0.62t), where t is the number of hours after 5 A.M. and A(t) is measured in vehicles per hour. Traffic is flowing smoothly at 5 A.M. with no vehicles waiting in line. You will be using calculus to determine the total number of vehicles that arrive at the toll plaza from 6 A.M. to 10 A.M., find the average rate of vehicle arrival, and determine whether the arrival rate is increasing or decreasing at 6 A.M.",
  "tasks": [
    "Write an integral expression that gives the total number of vehicles that arrive at the toll plaza from 6 A.M. to 10 A.M.",
    "Find the average value of the rate, in vehicles per hour, at which vehicles arrive at the toll plaza from 6 A.M. to 10 A.M.",
    "Determine if the rate at which vehicles arrive at the toll plaza at 6 A.M. is increasing or decreasing. Provide a reason for your answer."

    "Remember to consider the limits of integration when writing your integral expression.",
    "When finding the average rate, don't forget to divide by the length of the interval.",
    "Think about what it means for a rate to be increasing or decreasing. How can you determine this from the function A(t)?"
