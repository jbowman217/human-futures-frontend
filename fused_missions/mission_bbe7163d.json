  "background_context": "You are about to take part in a simulated version of the Algebra I Regents Examination, an exam administered by the University of the State of New York. This exam tests your understanding of algebraic concepts and their application to real-world scenarios. The exam consists of multiple parts, each containing a variety of questions. You are expected to answer all questions, using the information provided to determine your answers. Graphs and diagrams are a crucial part of the exam, and you should be prepared to utilize them effectively.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze the data of a ball's height above the ground at different time intervals and draw a valid conclusion.",
    "Formulate a system of inequalities to model a bus company's profit-making scenario.",
    "Use the given formulas and diagrams to answer questions, ensuring to clearly indicate the necessary steps, including appropriate formula substitutions, diagrams, graphs, charts, etc."
