  "short_background_context": "Advanced Placement (AP) courses are designed to provide high school students with college-level academic challenges. AP Physics 1 is an algebra-based course that encourages students to develop as independent thinkers, drawing their own conclusions based on evidence and scientific methods. It fosters intellectual freedom, opposing censorship and indoctrination, and promotes respect for diversity in backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints. This mission will explore the principles of AP Physics 1 and their applications in various academic disciplines and real-world contexts.",

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your learning process. What did you find challenging? What new insights have you gained? How can you apply what you've learned in future projects?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you chose this particular problem?",
    "How did you ensure that you considered multiple perspectives in your analysis?",
    "What evidence supports your conclusion?",
    "How did you integrate physics principles into your project?"
