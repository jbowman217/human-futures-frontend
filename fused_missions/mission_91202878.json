  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will explore the concept of probability and sampling distributions through a real-world problem. We will focus on a scenario where employees have a chance to receive a gift card each week. The probability of an employee being selected to receive a gift card is independent each week. We will use the binomial distribution to model this scenario and calculate the probability of a particular outcome. This mission will help you understand how these mathematical concepts are used in real-world situations and will also enhance your problem-solving skills.",
