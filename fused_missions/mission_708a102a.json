  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will explore the concepts of five-number summary and outlier detection in the context of a real-world scenario: analyzing the length of hospital stays. The five-number summary includes the minimum, lower quartile (Q1), median, upper quartile (Q3), and maximum of a dataset. Outliers are values that are significantly different from other observations in the dataset. There are different methods to identify outliers, and we will focus on two: Method A, which considers a value an outlier if it is greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above Q3 or below Q1, and Method B, which considers a value an outlier if it is 2 or more standard deviations away from the mean.",
