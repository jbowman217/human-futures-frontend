  "driving_question": "How can you use algebra and statistics to understand and implement the scoring guidelines for the AP Computer Science A exam's Calendar question?",
  "short_background_context": "The AP Computer Science A exam is a rigorous assessment that tests students' understanding of key concepts in computer science. One of the questions on the 2019 exam involved calculating the number of leap years in a given range and determining the day of the week for a specific date. This mission will guide you through understanding and implementing the scoring guidelines for this question, which involve key concepts in algebra and statistics. You'll need to understand how to initialize and use variables, loop through ranges, call methods, and calculate values based on these methods.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Analyze the scoring guidelines for the numberOfLeapYears part of the question. Identify the key algebraic and statistical concepts involved.",
    "Task 2: Implement a solution for the numberOfLeapYears part of the question, following the scoring guidelines. Test your solution with different year ranges.",
    "Task 3: Analyze the scoring guidelines for the dayOfWeek part of the question. Identify the key algebraic and statistical concepts involved. Implement a solution for this part, following the scoring guidelines. Test your solution with different dates."
