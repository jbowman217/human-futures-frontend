  "short_background_context": "The New York State Education Department conducts the Regents Examination in Algebra II to evaluate students' understanding and application of mathematical concepts. This examination is a comprehensive test that covers various topics such as Algebra, Statistics, Economics, and Geometry. The scoring guidelines provided by the department are designed to ensure a systematic and consistent method for awarding credit. The process involves multiple teachers scoring each student's paper, and the final score is a scale score converted from the total raw score.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze the scoring guidelines and understand the expectations of the examination.",
    "Solve sample constructed-response questions using your knowledge of Algebra, Statistics, Economics, and Geometry.",
    "Reflect on your answers, identify your strengths and weaknesses, and strategize on how to improve your performance."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What are the key components of the scoring guidelines?",
    "What strategies can you use to solve the constructed-response questions?",
    "How can you apply your knowledge of Algebra, Statistics, Economics, and Geometry to these questions?"
