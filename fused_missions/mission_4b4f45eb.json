  "driving_question": "How does mass incarceration impact our society, and what factors contribute to it?",
  "short_background_context": "Mass incarceration refers to the extensive imprisonment of people in the United States. It's a complex issue involving various government agencies and systems, including federal, state, local, and tribal systems. These systems collectively hold almost 2 million people in various types of facilities. The reasons for incarceration vary, and understanding them is crucial for reform. During the COVID-19 pandemic, prison and jail populations saw significant reductions, but these were temporary changes rather than permanent policy shifts. This mission will help you understand the dynamics of mass incarceration, its impact on society, and the factors contributing to it.",
