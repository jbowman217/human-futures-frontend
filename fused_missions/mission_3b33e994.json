  "short_background_context": "A company designs spinning toys using the family of functions y=cx^4 - x^2, where c is a positive constant. The shape of the spinning toy is generated when the region bounded by the x-axis and the graph of y=cx^4 - x^2 in the first quadrant is revolved about the x-axis. Both x and y are measured in inches. Your mission is to understand the design process of these toys by exploring the mathematical concepts involved.",
  "tasks": [
    "Find the area of the region in the first quadrant bounded by the x-axis and the graph of y=cx^4 - x^2 for a given value of c.",
    "Determine the value of c for a particular spinning toy, given the radius of the largest cross-sectional circular slice.",
    "Explore how changes in the value of c affect the design of the spinning toy."
