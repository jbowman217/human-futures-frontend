  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on the 2018 AP Computer Science A exam's free response question involving a frog simulation. The task involves simulating the distance traveled by a hopping frog and determining the proportion of successful frog hopping simulations. You will need to apply your understanding of algebraic concepts to calculate distances and proportions. Moreover, you will use economic principles to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the simulation, considering factors such as the number of hops and the goal distance.",
