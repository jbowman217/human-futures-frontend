  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will delve into the world of calculus, specifically focusing on particle motion analysis. We will be using a problem from the AP Calculus BC exam as our guide. The problem involves a particle moving along a curve with its position at time t given by (x(t), y(t)), where y(t) = 2sin(t) and the rate of change of x with respect to time, dx/dt, is given by e^cos(t). At time t=0, the particle is at position (1,0). Our goal is to understand the particle's motion by finding the acceleration vector at a specific time and determining when the speed of the particle first reaches a certain value.",

    "Task 1: Find the acceleration vector of the particle at time t=1. Show the setup for your calculations.",
    "Task 2: For 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03c0, find the first time t at which the speed of the particle is 1.5. Show the work that leads to your answer.",
    "Task 3: Analyze the results of Tasks 1 and 2. What do these results tell us about the particle's motion at these specific times?"
