  "driving_question": "How can we apply algebraic concepts and formulas to solve real-world problems?",
  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on the Algebra II Regents Examination from the University of the State of New York. This exam tests your knowledge and understanding of various algebraic concepts, including the use of graphs, formulas, and algebraic expressions to solve problems. You will be required to answer multiple-choice questions and perform computations. You will also need to interpret data from tables and use it to make calculations. This mission will challenge your algebraic skills and your ability to apply them in real-world contexts.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Analyze the population data of Austin, Texas from 1850 to 2010 and determine over which period of time the average rate of change in population was the greatest.",
    "Task 2: Identify which expression is not equivalent to 36 x6 2 25y4.",
    "Task 3: Determine the zeros of the polynomial function s(x) 5 x4 2 9x2 1 3x3 2 27x 2 10x2 1 90."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you understand by the term 'average rate of change'?",
    "How can you determine if two expressions are equivalent?",
    "What does it mean for a number to be a 'zero' of a polynomial function?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on the tasks you have completed. Which task did you find the most challenging and why? How did your understanding of algebraic concepts help you in solving these tasks?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain your thought process in determining the period of greatest average rate of change in population?",
    "How did you verify the equivalence or non-equivalence of the given expressions?",
    "Can you explain how you determined the zeros of the polynomial function?"

  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by using different data sets, algebraic expressions, or polynomial functions. They could also introduce additional constraints or parameters to the tasks.",
