  "background_context": "The Regents Examination in Geometry is a comprehensive test that assesses your understanding of various geometric concepts and their applications. In this mission, we will explore different aspects of Geometry, including algebraic representations, statistical interpretations, and economic applications. You will be given tasks that mimic the type of problems you might encounter in the Regents Examination, allowing you to apply and deepen your understanding of these concepts. Remember, the goal is not just to find the right answer, but to understand the process and logic behind it.",
  "tasks": [
    "Design a model that applies geometric principles to a real-world problem.",
    "Analyze a given geometric problem and propose multiple solution pathways.",
    "Interpret the results of a geometric model in the context of an economic or statistical scenario."

    "What are some real-world problems that could be solved using Geometry?",
    "What different methods can be used to solve a geometric problem?",
