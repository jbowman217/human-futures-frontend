  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on the AP Precalculus 2024 Scoring Commentary. It focuses on symbolic manipulations, particularly the use of algebraic methods and rules for exponents and logarithms. The mission involves solving equations and rewriting expressions. Students will work with functions and their domains, and apply their knowledge of trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponents. The tasks will require students to show their work and explain their reasoning.",
