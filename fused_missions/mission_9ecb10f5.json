  "driving_question": "How can a federal job guarantee policy achieve permanent full employment?",
  "short_background_context": "Full employment has been a part of the policy discourse in the United States since the early twentieth century. One of the most notable proponents of true full employment was President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His vision of \u201ceconomic security\u201d for all is a touchstone for full-employment advocates. Today, economists and policymakers, including the governors of the Federal Reserve System, tend to associate \u201cfull employment\u201d with a four-to-six percent unemployment rate. This measure of unemployment counts workers who do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the previous four weeks, and are currently available for work. It does not count the millions who have stopped actively seeking employment, or those inadequately employed in temporary, seasonal, or other precarious employment situations.",
