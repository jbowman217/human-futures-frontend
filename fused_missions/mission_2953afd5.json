  "grade_band": "High School",
  "subjects": [
    "Algebra",
    "Statistics",
    "Climate",
    "Geometry"
  ],
  "driving_question": "How can we apply algebra, statistics, and geometry to understand and address real-world climate issues?",
  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on a high school examination in Algebra II, which includes elements of statistics and geometry. The examination requires students to utilize a variety of mathematical skills and concepts to answer questions. This mission remixes these elements to focus on climate-related issues, demonstrating how mathematical skills can be applied to understand and address real-world problems. Students will need to use a graphing calculator, a straightedge ruler, and their critical thinking skills to complete the tasks.",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_1": "Using algebraic expressions, model the relationship between carbon emissions and global temperature rise."
    },
    {
      "task_2": "Conduct a statistical analysis of historical climate data to predict future trends."
    },
    {
      "task_3": "Design a geometric model of a sustainable city, taking into account factors such as energy efficiency and land use."
    }
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you already know about climate change and its causes?",
    "How can mathematics help us understand and address climate change?",
    "What are some ways that cities can be designed to be more sustainable?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on what you have learned about the application of algebra, statistics, and geometry to real-world problems. How has this mission changed your understanding of these subjects and their relevance to issues like climate change?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain how you arrived at your answer?",
    "What assumptions did you make in your calculations?",
    "How would your model change if certain variables were altered?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by choosing a different real-world issue to focus on, such as public health or economic inequality. They could also incorporate additional mathematical concepts or tools into their models.",
