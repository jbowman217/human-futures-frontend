  "short_background_context": "The University of the State of New York conducts a Regents High School Examination in Algebra I. This examination assesses your understanding and application of various concepts in Algebra, Statistics, Economics, and Geometry. The examination is scored by a minimum of three mathematics teachers, and each student's work is evaluated based on a systematic and consistent method for awarding credit. Your task is to prepare for and simulate the examination process, applying your knowledge and skills to solve constructed-response questions.",
  "tasks": [
    "Review the Model Response Set provided by the Department and understand the scoring guidance.",
    "Attempt constructed-response questions that cover various concepts in Algebra, Statistics, Economics, and Geometry.",
    "Self-score your answers using the provided rubrics and convert your total raw score to a scale score using the conversion chart."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What topics in Algebra, Statistics, Economics, and Geometry do you feel confident about?",
