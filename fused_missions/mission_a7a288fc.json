  "background_context": "The New York State Education Department administers Mathematics Tests annually and releases a significant portion of the test questions for review and use. These questions are designed to assess the New York State P-12 Next Generation Learning Standards for Mathematics, which focus on standard algorithms and conceptual standards. The questions often require students to complete multiple steps, apply multiple mathematics skills, and demonstrate real-world applications. They are framed within the context of real-world applications or require students to complete multiple steps. Many of these questions are linked to more than one standard, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills and concepts.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze and answer a set of multiple-choice questions that assess standard algorithms and conceptual standards.",
    "Complete a one-credit constructed-response question that requires multiple steps, assessing procedural skills, as well as conceptual understanding and application.",
    "Complete a three-credit constructed-response question that requires you to show your work in completing two or more tasks or a more extensive problem."
