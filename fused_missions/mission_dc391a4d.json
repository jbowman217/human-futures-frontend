  "driving_question": "How can we use algebra and economics principles to simulate and analyze a frog hopping scenario in computer science?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will be exploring a problem from the 2018 AP Computer Science A exam that involves simulating the hopping of a frog. The problem requires understanding of both algebraic concepts and principles of economics. The frog's hopping is simulated through a series of steps, each of which contributes to the overall distance traveled by the frog. The goal is to determine whether the frog reaches a certain distance or falls short. The problem also involves running multiple simulations and determining the proportion of successful attempts. This requires understanding of probability and statistics, which are key concepts in economics.",
