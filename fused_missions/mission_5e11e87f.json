  "short_background_context": "The University of the State of New York conducts a REGENTS HIGH SCHOOL EXAMINATION in Algebra II. This examination contains a variety of questions that test students' understanding of algebraic concepts and statistical principles. These questions require students to apply their knowledge to solve problems and interpret results. The questions cover a range of topics including determining the zeros of a function, solving equations, and analyzing probabilities of independent events. This mission will focus on three questions from the examination, each of which presents a unique challenge and opportunity to apply your learning in Algebra, Statistics, Economics, and Geometry.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Algebraically determine the zeros of the function r(x) = 3x^3 + 12x^2 - 3x - 12",
    "Task 2: Given a > 0, solve the equation aax1 23 for x algebraically",
    "Task 3: Given P(A) = 1/3 and P(B) = 5/12, where A and B are independent events, determine P(A \u2229 B)"

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What methods can you use to find the zeros of a function?",
    "How can you solve the equation given in Task 2?",
    "What does it mean for events A and B to be independent, and how does this affect the calculation of P(A \u2229 B)?"

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on how your understanding of algebra and statistics helped you solve these problems. What strategies were most effective? What challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you chose that method to find the zeros?",
    "What steps did you take to isolate x in the equation?",
    "Can you explain the formula you used to calculate P(A \u2229 B)?"
