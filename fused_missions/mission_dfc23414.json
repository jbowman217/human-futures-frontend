  "short_background_context": "In May 2024, New York State administered Mathematics Tests, releasing approximately 75% of the questions for review and use. These questions are designed to assess the New York State P\u201312 Next Generation Learning Standards for Mathematics, focusing on standard algorithms and conceptual standards. The questions often require students to apply multiple skills and concepts simultaneously, often within the context of real-world applications. The questions come in different formats: multiple-choice, one-credit, two-credit, and three-credit constructed-response questions, each requiring different levels of procedural skills, conceptual understanding, and application.",
