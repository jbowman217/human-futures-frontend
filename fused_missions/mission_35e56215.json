  "short_background_context": "The Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science A exam is a standardized test that assesses students' understanding of the principles of computer science, including problem-solving, algorithm development, and data analysis. One of the questions in the 2019 exam involved calculating the number of leap years in a given range. This task required students to apply their knowledge of algebra and statistics, as they had to initialize a numeric variable, loop through each year in the range, call a function to determine if a year was a leap year, and update a count based on the result. This mission will guide you through a similar process, allowing you to apply your mathematical skills in a practical context.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Initialize a numeric variable to count the number of leap years.",
    "Task 2: Develop a loop that goes through each year in a given range.",
    "Task 3: Create a function that determines if a year is a leap year and apply this function within your loop."

  "reflection_prompt": "What did you learn about the application of algebra and statistics in solving real-world problems? How did you find the process of developing a function to determine leap years?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why we need to initialize a numeric variable before starting the loop?",
    "What is the purpose of the leap year function in our loop?",
    "How does the count update based on the result of the leap year function?"
