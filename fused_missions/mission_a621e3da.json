  "driving_question": "How can we apply calculus concepts to solve real-world problems involving functions and areas?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will examine a sample question from the AP Calculus BC exam. This question involves exploring the areas enclosed by the graphs of two functions, f and g, and the application of calculus concepts such as integration, limits, and differentiation. We will also investigate the properties of a third function, h, which is derived from f. Through this mission, you will deepen your understanding of calculus and its applications, and gain practice in tackling complex, multi-part problems.",

    {
      "task": "Find the area of the shaded region enclosed by the graphs of f and g."

    {
      "task": "Evaluate the improper integral of g(x) from 0 to infinity, or show that the integral diverges."
    },
    {
      "task": "Let h be the function defined by h(x) = x * f'(x). Find the value of the integral of h(x) from 0 to 3."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you know about the functions f and g from the information provided?",
    "How can you use integration to find the area enclosed by two functions?",
    "What does it mean for an integral to diverge, and how can you determine whether this is the case?"

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your understanding of the calculus concepts applied in this mission. How confident do you feel in your ability to solve similar problems?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Remember to consider the properties of the functions involved when solving these problems.",
    "Consider the steps involved in evaluating an integral. How can you apply these steps to solve the tasks?",
    "Think about the relationship between a function and its derivative. How does this relationship help you solve the third task?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Try to create your own problem involving the concepts of integration, limits, and differentiation. You could consider different functions or different regions of integration.",
