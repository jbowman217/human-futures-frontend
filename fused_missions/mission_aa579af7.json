  "short_background_context": "In statistics, data collection is a crucial process that can significantly impact the results of a study. One common method of data collection is self-reporting, where subjects provide information about themselves. However, this method can introduce bias due to subjects' poor memory, intentional dishonesty, or misunderstanding of the information being asked. For example, if subjects are asked to keep a daily journal of the number of miles they walk, they may underreport or overreport their activity. This can result in a biased estimation of the mean daily miles walked for the target population. The use of technology, such as activity trackers, can help to reduce this bias by providing a more accurate record of daily activity.",
