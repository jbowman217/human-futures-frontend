  "short_background_context": "In May 2023, New York State administered Mathematics Tests for grade 7, with 75% of the test questions now available for review and use. These questions are designed to assess the New York State P\u201312 Next Generation Learning Standards for Mathematics, incorporating both grade-level standards and the 'Standards for Mathematical Practices.' The questions are often framed within the context of real-world applications and require students to complete multiple steps, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills and concepts. The test includes multiple-choice questions, as well as one, two, and three-credit constructed-response questions that require students to show their work and understanding of mathematical procedures, concepts, and applications.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze the released questions from the 2023 Mathematics Test and identify the mathematical concepts and procedures being assessed.",
    "Choose one of the released questions and write a step-by-step solution, explaining the mathematical concepts and procedures used.",
    "Create a new real-world problem that could be solved using the same mathematical concepts and procedures as one of the released questions."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What mathematical concepts and procedures do you recognize in the released questions?",

    "Can you explain why you chose that particular mathematical concept or procedure?",
    "How does this concept or procedure apply to the problem?",
