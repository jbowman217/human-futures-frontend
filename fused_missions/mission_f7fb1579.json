  "title": "AP Computer Science A: 2D Arrays and Economics",
  "grade_band": "9-12",
  "subjects": [
    "Algebra",
    "Economics"
  ],
  "driving_question": "How can we use 2D arrays in computer science to understand and solve economic problems?",
  "short_background_context": "In AP Computer Science A, you have been learning about 2D arrays and how they can be used to store and manipulate data. In this mission, you will apply this knowledge to a real-world economic problem. You will be given a 2D array representing a candy box, where each cell represents a different type of candy. Your task is to manipulate this array to solve various problems, such as moving a certain type of candy to the first row or removing a candy of a certain flavor. This will help you understand how 2D arrays can be used to solve complex problems and how these concepts can be applied to economics.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Write a function that moves a specific type of candy to the first row of the candy box.",
    "Task 2: Write a function that removes a candy of a certain flavor from the candy box.",
    "Task 3: Discuss how these functions could be used to solve an economic problem, such as managing inventory in a candy store."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "How can 2D arrays be used to represent real-world data?",
    "What are some potential challenges in manipulating 2D arrays?",
    "How can the concepts of computer science be applied to economics?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on how your understanding of 2D arrays has deepened through this mission. How can you apply these concepts to solve other real-world problems?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you chose this approach for moving the candy?",
    "What would happen if the flavor you are trying to remove is not in the candy box?",
    "How does this relate to the concept of supply and demand in economics?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Consider a different scenario where you have a 2D array representing a warehouse of different products. How would you modify your functions to manage this inventory?",
