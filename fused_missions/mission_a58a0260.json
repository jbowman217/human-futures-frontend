  "driving_question": "How can we use calculus to model real-world situations such as the flow of gasoline into a tank?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will be exploring a real-world scenario involving a customer at a gas station pumping gasoline into a gas tank. The rate of flow of gasoline is modeled by a differentiable function, f, where f(t) is measured in gallons per second and t is measured in seconds since pumping began. We will be using concepts from algebra, statistics, and economics to understand and solve problems related to this scenario.",

    "Interpret the meaning of the integral from 60 to 135 seconds of f(t) in the context of the problem. Use a right Riemann sum with the three subintervals [60, 90], [90, 120], and [120, 135] to approximate the value of the integral.",
    "Determine if there must exist a value of c, for 60 < c < 120, such that f'(c) = 0. Justify your answer.",

    "Can you explain why you chose those particular subintervals for the Riemann sum?",
