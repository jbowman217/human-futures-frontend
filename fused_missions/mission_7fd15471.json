  "driving_question": "How can we use algorithms to manipulate and analyze text data?",
  "short_background_context": "In the field of computer science, algorithms are used to solve problems and perform tasks. One common task is manipulating and analyzing text data, which involves operations like finding occurrences of a string, replacing them, and more. In this mission, you will be working on a 'Phrase Editor', a program that manipulates text data. You will be using the AP Computer Science A 2017 Scoring Guidelines as a reference to understand the problem and create your own solutions.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Write an algorithm to replace the nth occurrence of a given string with a given replacement in a text.",
    "Task 2: Write an algorithm to find the index of the last occurrence of a given string in a text.",
    "Task 3: Apply the algorithms you've written to a real-world economic text data to identify and replace specific terms."

    "What is an algorithm and how is it used in computer science?",
    "What steps might be involved in finding the nth occurrence of a string in a text?",
    "How might you modify this process to find the last occurrence of a string?"

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on the process of creating these algorithms. What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them? How can these algorithms be applied in other contexts?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain your thought process behind the algorithm you wrote?",
    "What would happen if we changed the nth occurrence to a different number?",
    "How might your algorithm handle a text that doesn't contain the string you're looking for?"
