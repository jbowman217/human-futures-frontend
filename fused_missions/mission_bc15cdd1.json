  "driving_question": "How can we apply calculus concepts to model real-world scenarios such as the flow of gasoline and the movement of a particle?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will be exploring two real-world scenarios that can be modeled using calculus concepts. The first scenario involves a customer at a gas station pumping gasoline into a gas tank. The rate of flow of gasoline is modeled by a differentiable function. The second scenario involves a particle moving along a curve. The particle's position at time t is given by a function, and its acceleration and speed are also modeled using mathematical functions. We will be using concepts such as Riemann sums, derivatives, and integrals to solve problems related to these scenarios.",
  "tasks": [
    "Using the given data, approximate the value of the integral from 60 to 135 of the rate of flow function using a right Riemann sum.",
    "Justify whether there must exist a value of c, for 60 < c < 120, such that the derivative of the rate of flow function at c is 0.",
    "Using the given model for the rate of flow of gasoline, find the average rate of flow over the time interval 0 to 150. Show the setup for your calculations."

    "Remember, a Riemann sum provides an approximation of the area under a curve. How can this concept be applied to the given problem?",
    "Consider the Mean Value Theorem in justifying whether a certain value of c exists.",
    "In finding the average rate of flow, consider how the integral of a function over an interval can be used."
