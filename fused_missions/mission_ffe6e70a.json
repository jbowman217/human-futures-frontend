  "driving_question": "What kind of measurements can you make of the Moon and how can these measurements be used in real-world applications?",
  "short_background_context": "NASA is planning to return humans to the Moon by 2020 and you, as a student, could be part of the next generation of explorers. The Moon Math Challenge provides an opportunity to enhance your measurement skills, a fundamental building block for science, technology, and engineering. In this mission, you will emulate NASA scientists and engineers by proposing a project, conducting an investigation, collecting real data, and presenting your findings. This interactive mission allows you to engage with NASA's Digital Learning Network, participate in hands-on activities, and ask questions about your specific projects.",
  "tasks": [
    "Propose a project to NASA that involves making a measurement of the Moon. This could be the diameter of a crater, the time it takes for the Moon to rotate once on its axis, or whether the Moon moves at a constant speed in its orbit.",
    "Conduct an investigation by collecting real data. Use appropriate techniques, tools, and formulas to determine measurements.",
    "Present your findings to a panel, just as a real scientist would at a professional conference. This should include an oral and written presentation summarizing the results of your experiment."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What aspect of the Moon are you interested in measuring and why?",
    "What tools and techniques will you need to collect your data?",
    "How will you ensure your measurements are accurate and reliable?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on the process of conducting your investigation. What challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What did you learn from this experience?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain your choice of measurement in more detail?",
    "Why did you choose the tools and techniques you used?",
    "How did you ensure the reliability of your data?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students could remix the problem by choosing a different celestial body to measure or by proposing a new method for collecting data.",
