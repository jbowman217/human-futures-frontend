  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will explore the scoring guidelines of the 2021 AP\u00ae Statistics exam. We will focus on the concepts of the five-number summary and outliers in a data set. The five-number summary includes the minimum, lower quartile (Q1), median, upper quartile (Q3), and maximum of a data set. Outliers are data points that significantly differ from the rest of the data. Two methods of identifying outliers will be discussed: Method A uses the interquartile range (IQR), and Method B uses standard deviations. Understanding these concepts is crucial in various fields, including economics, where data interpretation can influence policy decisions.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Calculate the five-number summary of a given data set.",
    "Task 2: Identify outliers in the data set using Method A (1.5\u00d7IQR rule) and Method B (2 standard deviations rule).",
    "Task 3: Justify your outlier identification by calculating the lower and upper outlier criteria for both methods."
