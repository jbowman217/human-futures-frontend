  "short_background_context": "In the field of computer science, algorithms play a crucial role in solving complex problems. One such algorithm is the 'successor array' algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the position of a given integer in a 2D integer array. It is a practical tool for organizing and accessing data. In this mission, we will explore how this algorithm can be applied to economic scenarios. For instance, imagine you are an economist trying to analyze a large dataset of economic indicators. Using the successor array algorithm could help you locate specific data points quickly and efficiently. Understanding such algorithms is not only beneficial for computer scientists but also for economists who deal with large volumes of data.",
