  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on the Regents Examination in Algebra II, a high-stakes assessment administered by the New York State Department of Education. The exam tests students' understanding of various algebraic concepts and their ability to apply these concepts in different contexts. It includes constructed-response questions, which require students to construct their own responses rather than choosing from provided options. The scoring process is rigorous and involves multiple mathematics teachers. This mission will provide you with an opportunity to engage with the type of tasks you might encounter on such an exam.",
