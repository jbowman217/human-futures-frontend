  "driving_question": "How can we interpret and apply the scoring guidelines for AP Computer Science A?",
  "short_background_context": "In the AP Computer Science A exam, understanding the scoring guidelines is as important as mastering the subject matter. The guidelines provide a detailed breakdown of how points are awarded for each question. For instance, in the 2017 exam, a question on 'Digits' had points allocated for specific tasks like constructing a 'digitList', identifying a digit in 'num', and adding all identified digits to a list. Understanding the scoring guidelines can help you strategize and prioritize your responses during the exam.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze the scoring guidelines for the 'Digits' question. Identify the key tasks that earn points and summarize them in your own words.",
    "Develop a strategy for answering the 'Digits' question based on the scoring guidelines. Explain your strategy and why you think it will be effective.",
    "Create a mock response to the 'Digits' question following your strategy. Then, use the scoring guidelines to grade your own response."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What are the key tasks that earn points in the 'Digits' question?",
    "How would you prioritize these tasks during the exam?",
    "What strategies can you employ to ensure you complete all the key tasks?"

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your strategy and mock response. How well did your strategy work? What would you do differently next time?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why your strategy would be effective?",
    "How did you ensure that all key tasks were completed in your mock response?",
    "What challenges did you face in applying the scoring guidelines to your own response?"
