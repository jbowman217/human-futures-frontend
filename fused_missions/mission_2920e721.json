  "driving_question": "How can we analyze and interpret the K12 Edtech Safety Benchmark to understand and improve internet safety in schools?",
  "short_background_context": "The Internet Society Foundation has funded a project to research and analyze the safety of educational technology (Edtech) in K12 schools. This project has resulted in the K12 Edtech Safety Benchmark, a comprehensive document that provides insights into the current state of internet safety in schools. The benchmark covers various aspects, including the types of apps used in schools, the safety measures in place, and the potential risks and threats. As students who are directly affected by these findings, it's crucial to understand this benchmark, interpret its data, and think critically about how internet safety in schools can be improved.",
