  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on a series of questions from the Algebra II Regents High School Examination conducted by the University of the State of New York. The examination requires students to answer questions involving algebraic expressions, diagrams, graphs, and charts. A particular focus is on the simplification of complex expressions involving real numbers and imaginary units. The exam emphasizes the importance of showing work, with a correct numerical answer with no work shown receiving only partial credit. In this mission, we will explore these concepts in depth and understand how to simplify such expressions.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Given x is a real number, write the expression in simplest a + bi form: (x + 2i)(3 - 2xi) + 2x2i",
    "Task 2: Given another complex expression, simplify it and represent it in the simplest a + bi form.",
    "Task 3: Create a graph to visually represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number resulting from the simplification."
