  "driving_question": "How can we apply algebra and statistics to solve real-world problems in computer science, specifically in the context of a calendar system?",
  "short_background_context": "In the AP Computer Science A exam, students are often required to solve complex problems using their understanding of computer science principles. One such problem is based on a calendar system, where students are required to calculate the number of leap years in a range and determine the day of the week for a given date. This problem not only tests their understanding of computer science but also their ability to apply algebra and statistics in a real-world context. This mission will guide you through the process of solving such a problem, helping you understand the application of these subjects in a practical scenario.",
