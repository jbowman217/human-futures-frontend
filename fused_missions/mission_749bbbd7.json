  "short_background_context": "Computer programming is a critical skill in today's digital world, and understanding the common errors that programmers make can help us improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our code. These errors can also have economic impacts, such as the cost to fix the errors, the time lost due to these errors, and the potential loss of customers or users due to faulty software. In this mission, we will explore the common errors identified in the AP Computer Science A scoring guidelines and examine their potential economic impacts.",
