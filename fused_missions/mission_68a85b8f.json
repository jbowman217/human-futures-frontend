  "driving_question": "How does economics impact our daily lives and the world around us?",
  "short_background_context": "Economics is not just about money, it's about understanding the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It's about understanding what people need and want, and how these needs and wants are met. It's also about understanding the disparities in wealth and resources around the world. In this mission, we will delve into the world of economics, exploring concepts like needs and wants, production, distribution, and wealth inequality.",
