  "driving_question": "How can we use mathematical concepts to understand the properties and behavior of black holes?",
  "short_background_context": "Black holes are one of the most intriguing and mysterious subjects in the field of astronomy. Despite their complexity, many aspects of black holes can be understood using simple algebra and pre-algebra mathematical skills. This mission aims to explore black hole concepts in their simplest mathematical form. Students will need to be familiar with scientific notation and be able to perform simple algebraic computations involving exponentiation and square-roots. The activities are organized according to progressive difficulty in mathematics, allowing students to build on their understanding as they progress through the tasks.",
