  "short_background_context": "The AP Computer Science A exam is a rigorous test that assesses students' understanding of computer science principles and their ability to apply these principles in programming. The exam includes a free-response section, where students are required to write code to solve given problems. The scoring of this section is based on a detailed rubric, which assigns points for correctly implementing specific features and deducts points for certain errors. Understanding this rubric can help you write better code and perform better on the exam. In this mission, we will focus on the scoring guidelines for a sample question about implementing a 'Light Board' program.",
