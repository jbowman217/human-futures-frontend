  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will be exploring a sample question from the 2022 AP Calculus BC exam. The question involves analyzing the motion of a particle along a curve in the xy-plane. The motion of the particle is described by two equations, dx/dt = 1 + t^2 and dy/dt = ln(2 + t^2). At a specific time, t = 4, the particle is at the point (1, 5). The question asks us to find the slope of the line tangent to the path of the particle, the speed of the particle, the acceleration vector of the particle, and the y-coordinate of the particle\u2019s position at a later time. We will be using concepts of calculus including derivatives, integrals, and vectors to solve this problem.",

  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Remember, the slope of the tangent line can be found using the derivative of the function.",
    "To calculate the speed of the particle, you can use the Pythagorean theorem with the derivatives of the functions.",
    "The acceleration vector can be found by taking the second derivative of the functions.",
    "To find the y-coordinate at a later time, consider using the integral of the dy/dt function."
