  "background_context": "The 'Babies over Billionaires Act of 2022' is a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. It proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to adopt mark-to-market income tax rules for taxpayers with net worth above a specified threshold. The bill highlights that billionaires have disproportionately benefited during the pandemic, with their collective net worth growing by $1.7 trillion. It suggests that a gradual tax on unrealized capital gains could raise more than $1 trillion over 10 years. The revenue from this tax is proposed to be invested in children, particularly in the first 1000 days of life, to support their physical development, brain development, social-emotional health, and long-term well-being.",
