  "short_background_context": "The Regents High School Examination is a standardized examination that students in the state of New York must pass to graduate from high school. It covers a range of subjects, including Algebra, Geometry, Statistics, and Economics. The exam requires students to utilize a variety of skills, including graphing, problem-solving, and critical thinking. The exam is rigorous, with multiple parts and a variety of question types, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Students must use a graphing calculator and straightedge (ruler) during the examination. This mission will focus on the Algebra I examination, exploring key concepts and skills needed to successfully navigate the exam.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze and solve the algebraic and geometric problems provided in the Regents High School Examination.",
