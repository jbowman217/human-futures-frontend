  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we'll be exploring an AP Calculus BC sample question that involves analyzing a function and its derivative. The function f is defined on the closed interval [-2, 8] and satisfies f(2) = 1. The graph of f', the derivative of f, consists of two line segments and a semicircle. We'll be tasked with determining whether f has a relative minimum or maximum at x = 6, identifying intervals where the graph of f is concave down, calculating a limit, and finding the absolute minimum value of f on the given interval.",
  "tasks": [
    "Determine whether f has a relative minimum, a relative maximum, or neither at x = 6. Provide a reason for your answer.",
    "Identify on what open intervals, if any, is the graph of f concave down. Provide a reason for your answer.",
    "Calculate the limit as x approaches 2 of (6x^3 - 5x + 6)/(x - 2), or show that it does not exist. Justify your answer.",
    "Find the absolute minimum value of f on the closed interval [-2, 8]. Justify your answer."

    "What does it mean for a function to have a relative minimum or maximum at a certain point?",
    "What does the derivative of a function tell us about the behavior of the function?",
    "How can we determine where a function is concave down based on its derivative?",
    "What is L\u2019Hospital\u2019s Rule and when can we apply it?",
    "How can we find the absolute minimum value of a function on a given interval?"

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on the process you used to analyze the function and its derivative. What strategies were most helpful? What concepts were most challenging?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why the sign of f' does not change at x = 6?",
    "What does it mean for f' to be decreasing on an interval?",
    "Why are we allowed to apply L\u2019Hospital\u2019s Rule in this situation?",
    "How did you determine the absolute minimum value of f on the interval [-2, 8]?"
