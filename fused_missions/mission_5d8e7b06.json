  "short_background_context": "In the world of gaming, there are often rewards and prizes that can be won. These rewards are usually determined by probability, a mathematical concept that measures the likelihood of an event happening. In this mission, we will be looking at a game where players open geodes to find a red crystal. The probability of finding a red crystal in a geode is 0.08. We will be using the concepts of mean, standard deviation, and geometric distribution to solve problems related to this game scenario.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the number of geodes a player opens until finding a red crystal.",
    "Task 2: Calculate the probability of a player opening 3 geodes and not finding a red crystal.",
    "Task 3: Calculate the probability of a player opening 4 geodes and either not finding a red crystal or finding a red crystal on the fourth geode."
