  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will explore a problem from the AP Calculus BC exam. The problem involves a particle moving along a curve in the xy-plane. The particle's position at any given time t seconds is given by the coordinates (x(t), y(t)). We will use calculus to analyze the particle's motion, including its speed, total distance traveled, and changes in its y-coordinate over specific time intervals. We will also determine when the particle is moving towards the x-axis. This mission will help you understand how calculus can be used to analyze real-world problems involving motion.",
