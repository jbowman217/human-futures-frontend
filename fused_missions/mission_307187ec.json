  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will focus on the concept of statistical inference, specifically hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that uses sample data to evaluate the validity of a hypothesis about a population. We will be looking at a real-world scenario where an exercise center is trying to determine the interest of its members in online fitness classes, divided into two age groups: 18 to 55 years and 56 years or older. We will use a two-sample z-test to compare the proportions of these two populations. The mission will guide you through the process of stating the null and alternative hypotheses, identifying the appropriate test, verifying the conditions for the test, calculating the test statistic and p-value, and drawing a conclusion.",
