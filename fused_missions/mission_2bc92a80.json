  "driving_question": "How can we use computer science concepts to understand and solve Latin Squares?",
  "short_background_context": "Latin Squares is a mathematical concept that has been used in various fields, including statistics, coding theory, and experimental design. A Latin Square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. In this mission, we will explore the concept of Latin Squares through the lens of computer science, specifically using AP Computer Science A scoring guidelines. You will engage with the scoring rubric, understand the penalties and rewards in the scoring system, and apply these concepts to solve Latin Squares problems.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Analyze the AP Computer Science A scoring guidelines, focusing on the penalties and rewards. Make a list of the key factors to consider when answering a question.",
    "Task 2: Using the scoring guidelines, create a 1-D array that contains the values from one column of a 2-D array. Ensure your solution adheres to the scoring guidelines.",
    "Task 3: Check conditions to determine if a square 2-D array is a Latin square. Use the scoring guidelines to ensure your solution is accurate and efficient."
