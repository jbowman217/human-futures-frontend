  "short_background_context": "The New York State Education Department administers Mathematics Tests annually, releasing a significant portion of the questions for review and use. These questions are designed to assess the New York State P\u201312 Learning Standards for Mathematics, including multiple-choice, short-response, and extended-response questions. Multiple-choice questions assess standard algorithms and conceptual standards, often within real-world applications or requiring multiple steps. Short-response questions require students to complete tasks and show their work, often involving multiple steps, multiple mathematics skills, and real-world applications. Extended-response questions ask students to show their work in completing two or more tasks or a more extensive problem, assessing mathematical procedures, conceptual understanding, and application.",
