  "driving_question": "How can we apply the principles of calculus to solve real-world problems involving area, volume, and solids of revolution?",
  "short_background_context": "Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies continuous change. It has two fundamental branches: Differential Calculus, which studies the rate of change, and Integral Calculus, which studies the accumulation of quantities. In this mission, we will explore the principles of calculus, specifically focusing on area, volume, and solids of revolution. We will use the concepts of definite integrals, improper integrals, and integration by parts to solve problems. We will also explore how these principles can be applied to real-world situations.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Calculate the area of a given region using definite integrals.",
    "Task 2: Determine the volume of a solid with a given base and cross-sectional area using definite integrals and integration by parts.",
    "Task 3: Find the volume of a solid generated by revolving a given region around the x-axis using improper integrals."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you know about definite and improper integrals?",
    "How can integration by parts be used to solve problems?",
    "What is a solid of revolution and how can its volume be calculated?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your understanding of the principles of calculus before and after completing the tasks. How has your understanding of area, volume, and solids of revolution changed? What challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "What is the relationship between the integral and the area under a curve?",
    "How does integration by parts help us solve more complex integrals?",
    "What is the significance of the limits of integration in the context of the problem?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students can remix the problem by changing the functions used to define the regions, altering the axis of revolution, or considering different cross-sectional shapes for the solids.",
