  "driving_question": "How can we use calculus to understand and predict the growth of a bacteria population in a petri dish?",
  "short_background_context": "You are a microbiologist studying the growth of a bacteria population in a petri dish. The density of the bacteria population at a distance r centimeters from the center of the dish is given by an increasing, differentiable function f, where f(r) is measured in milligrams per square centimeter. You are tasked with understanding the rate at which the bacteria population is increasing and predicting the total mass of the bacteria in the petri dish.",

    "Use the data provided to estimate f\u2032(2.25) and interpret the meaning of your answer in the context of this problem.",
