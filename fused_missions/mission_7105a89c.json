Indicates that keeping a daily journal could result in a bias that would be avoided by using activity trackers AND provides a reasonable explanation. 2. Provides a description of a bias that refers to the use of a daily journal resulting in a systematic/consistent underreporting or overreporting of daily miles walked."
