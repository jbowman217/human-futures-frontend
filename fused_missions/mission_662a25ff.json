  "short_background_context": "The ISTE Standards provide a comprehensive guide to transforming learning systems to improve student outcomes. These standards emphasize the role of technology in enhancing learning, fostering digital citizenship, constructing knowledge, and promoting innovation. This mission aims to explore how we can apply these standards across various subjects, including Economics, Geometry, Statistics, Ethics, and Algebra. You will be tasked with setting personal learning goals, leveraging technology to achieve them, and reflecting on the learning process to improve outcomes.",
