  "short_background_context": "In 2013, New York State began administering tests designed to assess student performance in accordance with the instructional shifts and rigor demanded by the new New York State P-12 Learning Standards in Mathematics. These tests include multiple-choice, short-response, and extended-response questions, each designed to assess different aspects of mathematical understanding and proficiency. The tests are framed within the context of real-world applications, and often require students to complete multiple steps and apply multiple mathematical skills. This mission will involve analyzing and understanding the structure and content of these tests.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze a set of multiple-choice questions from the New York State Mathematics Test and identify the mathematical concepts being assessed in each question.",
    "Create a short-response question that could appear on the test, complete with a detailed answer key explaining the correct response and the mathematical concepts involved.",
    "Critique an extended-response question from the test, discussing its strengths and weaknesses in assessing mathematical understanding and proficiency."
