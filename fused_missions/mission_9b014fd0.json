  "driving_question": "How can we develop a fair and consistent rubric for assessing programming assignments that encourages creativity and critical thinking?",
  "short_background_context": "In programming courses, students often encounter issues with grading inconsistencies. Traditionally, programming assignments and projects are graded based on an answer scheme, which includes the source code as a model answer. Marks are then allocated to specific lines of code. This method often leads to little or no consideration for creativity and originality in student solutions. Additionally, grading is often carried out by different individuals, leading to inconsistencies. This mission is inspired by a study published in The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology, which proposes the development of a rubric for grading programming assignments to address these issues.",
