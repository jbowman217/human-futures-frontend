  "short_background_context": "A power series is a series of the form \u2211a\u2099x\u207f, where a\u2099 represents the coefficient of the nth term and x is a variable. Power series are useful in many areas of mathematics, including calculus and algebra, and have applications in various fields such as physics and economics. In this mission, we will explore the concept of power series, their convergence, and how they can be used to model and solve economic problems.",
