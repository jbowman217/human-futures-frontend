  "driving_question": "How can we use mathematical models to predict real-world phenomena such as the melting of an ice sculpture?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we'll be examining a scenario involving an ice sculpture that melts in a way that can be modeled as a cone maintaining its conical shape as it decreases in size. The radius of the base of the cone is given by a twice-differentiable function r, where r(t) is measured in centimeters and t is measured in days. The rate of change of the radius over time is given, and we'll be using this data to answer a series of questions about the sculpture's melting process.",
  "tasks": [
    "Approximate r\u2032\u2032(8.5) using the average rate of change of r\u2032 over the interval 7 \u2264 t \u2264 10. Show the computations that lead to your answer, and indicate units of measure.",
    "Determine if there is a time t, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 3, for which r\u2032(t) = -6. Justify your answer.",
    "Create a mathematical model that predicts the radius of the ice sculpture at any given time."

  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What does the rate of change of the radius tell us about the sculpture?",
    "What does it mean for a function to be twice-differentiable?",
    "How might we use the given data to create a mathematical model?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on the process of creating a mathematical model for this real-world scenario. What challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What did you learn about the application of math in real-world situations?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "What does the sign of the rate of change tell you about the sculpture's size?",
    "Why is it important to justify your answer in task 2?",
    "What assumptions did you make in creating your model, and how might these affect its accuracy?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Consider a different shape of ice sculpture, such as a sphere or a cube. How would the model change? What additional information might you need?",
