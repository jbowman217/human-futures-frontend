  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will explore the motion of a particle in the xy-plane. The particle's position at any time t \u2265 0 is given by the coordinates (x(t), y(t)), and its velocity vector is (2te^(-t), sin(t^1.25)). At time t=0, the particle is at position (-2, 5). We will use algebraic and geometric concepts to find the speed and acceleration of the particle at a specific time, calculate the total distance traveled by the particle over a given interval, and determine the coordinates of the point where the particle is farthest to the left.",
