  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on a report by the U.S. Department of Education discussing the future of teaching and learning in relation to artificial intelligence (AI). The document provides insights and recommendations on how AI can be integrated into education, while also highlighting the importance of ethical considerations. As AI becomes more prevalent in our society, it's crucial to understand how it can be used to enhance education and what potential challenges we might face.",

    "Research and present a case study on how AI is currently being used in education.",
    "Analyze the ethical implications of using AI in education and propose solutions to potential issues.",
    "Design a hypothetical AI tool that could be used in a high school classroom. Explain how it could enhance teaching and learning, and discuss any potential ethical issues."
