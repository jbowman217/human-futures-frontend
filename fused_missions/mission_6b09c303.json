  "short_background_context": "The Framework for Teaching Evaluation Instrument is a tool developed by Charlotte Danielson in 2011 and further enhanced in 2013. It is designed to promote a common understanding of excellence in teaching among teachers, administrators, and the larger community. The framework includes definitions and expectations for each domain and component of teaching at each performance level. It also includes specific language around the instructional implications of the Common Core State Standards. This mission aims to help you understand and apply this framework in various subject contexts.",
