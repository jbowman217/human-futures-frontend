  "short_background_context": "The University of the State of New York conducts the Regents High School Examination for Algebra II. This examination tests students' understanding of Algebra II concepts and their ability to apply this knowledge to solve problems. The examination includes various types of questions requiring students to perform tasks such as formula substitutions, drawing diagrams, creating graphs, and more. All answers must be written in pen, except for graphs and drawings, which should be done in pencil. Students are expected to clearly indicate the necessary steps to solve each problem. For this mission, you will analyze and solve some of these problems.",
