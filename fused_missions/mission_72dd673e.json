  "short_background_context": "The business office of a local college is interested in finding out how students prefer to pay for their books at the beginning of a semester. This information is important for planning purposes, and to ensure that the office can accommodate the students' preferred payment methods. However, collecting this data can be challenging, as it is important to gather a sample that is representative of the entire student population, while minimizing bias. This mission will involve applying concepts from Algebra, Statistics, Geometry, Economics, and Ethics to solve this real-world problem.",
  "tasks": [
    "Design a survey that will gather data on students' preferred payment methods while minimizing bias.",
