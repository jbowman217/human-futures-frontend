  "short_background_context": "The New York State Education Department conducts the Regents Examination in Algebra II, which is a high-stakes test for high school students. The exam includes constructed-response questions that require students to apply their knowledge of algebra, statistics, economics, and geometry. The scoring process for this exam is rigorous and involves multiple teachers to ensure fairness and accuracy. The education department provides a Model Response Set to guide scoring. This mission will help you understand the examination process and apply your knowledge to solve similar problems.",
