  "short_background_context": "In AP Computer Science A, understanding the scoring criteria and coding guidelines is crucial for success in the exams. The scoring criteria are applied first and always take precedence. Penalty points can only be deducted in a part of the question that has earned credit via the question rubric. There are specific cases where penalty points are applied and cases where there are no penalties. For example, if you confuse array/collection access or use extraneous code that causes side effects, you can be penalized. However, if you have spelling/case discrepancies where there is no ambiguity, or if you use common mathematical symbols for operators, you will not be penalized. Understanding these guidelines can help you avoid mistakes and maximize your scores.",
