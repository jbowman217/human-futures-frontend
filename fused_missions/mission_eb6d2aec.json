  "short_background_context": "This mission is inspired by the Regents High School Examination in Algebra I from the University of the State of New York. The examination tests students' understanding and application of algebraic concepts, including solving equations, interpreting graphs, and reasoning mathematically. In this mission, you will be tasked with solving similar problems, requiring you to apply your knowledge of algebra, statistics, and geometry. Remember, diagrams are not necessarily drawn to scale, and a correct numerical answer with no work shown will receive only partial credit.",
