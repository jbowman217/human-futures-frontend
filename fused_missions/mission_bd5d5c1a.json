  "driving_question": "How can we analyze and understand the structure and requirements of the New York State Mathematics Test?",
  "short_background_context": "In 2013, New York State began administering tests designed to assess student performance in accordance with the instructional shifts and rigor demanded by the new New York State P-12 Learning Standards in Mathematics. The tests include multiple-choice questions, short-response questions, and extended-response questions, each designed to assess different mathematical skills and concepts. Many of these questions are linked to more than one standard, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills and concepts. The tests also have a real-world application, requiring students to complete multiple steps.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze a selection of multiple-choice questions from the test and identify the mathematical concepts they are designed to assess.",
    "Evaluate a set of short-response and extended-response questions. Identify the steps required to answer them and the mathematical skills they are testing.",
    "Create your own multiple-choice, short-response, and extended-response questions that align with the New York State P-12 Learning Standards for Mathematics."
