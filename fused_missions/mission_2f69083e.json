  "driving_question": "How is the scoring process for the Regents Examination in Algebra I conducted and how can it be improved?",
  "short_background_context": "The New York State Education Department conducts the Regents Examination in Algebra I, which is a high-stakes test for high school students. The scoring process for this examination is complex and involves multiple mathematics teachers. Each student's answer paper is scored by a minimum of three teachers, with no one teacher scoring more than approximately one-third of the constructed-response questions on a student's paper. The scoring is systematic and consistent, with rubrics provided for each question. However, the process is not without its challenges and potential areas for improvement.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Analyze the current scoring process for the Regents Examination in Algebra I and identify its strengths and weaknesses.",
    "Task 2: Propose a new scoring process that addresses the identified weaknesses while maintaining the strengths of the current process.",
    "Task 3: Develop a scoring rubric for a sample constructed-response question in Algebra I, incorporating the improvements proposed in Task 2."
