  "driving_question": "How can we analyze and understand the structure and demands of the New York State Mathematics Test?",
  "short_background_context": "In 2013, New York State began administering tests designed to assess student performance in accordance with the instructional shifts and rigor demanded by the new New York State P-12 Learning Standards in Mathematics. These tests are designed with multiple-choice questions, short-response questions, and extended-response questions, each assessing different aspects of mathematical understanding and application. The questions are often framed within the context of real-world applications and require students to complete multiple steps, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills and concepts.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze a set of multiple-choice questions from the 2019 test and identify the mathematical concepts and skills they are designed to assess.",
    "Choose a short-response question from the 2019 test and explain the steps required to solve it, identifying the mathematical concepts and skills involved.",
    "Choose an extended-response question from the 2019 test and break down the tasks involved in solving it. Explain how it assesses understanding of mathematical procedures, conceptual understanding, and application."
