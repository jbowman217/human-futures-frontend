  "driving_question": "How can you design a study to examine the impact of autopilot on car mileage?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will explore the principles of sampling and experimental design using a real-world scenario. The scenario involves a study where car owners are asked to estimate their mileage. The study is observational, as the car owners were not randomly assigned a car model and no treatment was imposed. We will delve into the criteria for scoring such a study and how to correctly implement a random process in experimental design. The goal is to understand how to create a study that is both reliable and valid, while also considering the practical constraints of real-world research.",
  "tasks": [
    "Identify the type of study (observational or experimental) and provide a justification.",
    "Design a random process for assigning treatments (with autopilot and without autopilot) for a 70-day period.",
    "Explain how your design ensures that every possible random assignment is equally likely."
