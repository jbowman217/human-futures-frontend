  "driving_question": "How can we use the properties of differentiable functions and their derivatives to solve real-world problems?",
  "short_background_context": "Differentiable functions are a fundamental concept in calculus, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation of quantities. The derivative of a function provides us with a wealth of information about the behavior of the function, such as its rate of change at a certain point, its local and global extrema, and points of inflection. In this mission, we will explore a differentiable function and its derivative, represented as a graph consisting of a semicircle and two line segments. We will use this information to solve various problems related to the function and its derivative.",
  "tasks": [
    "Find the values of the function at specific points using the given graph of the derivative.",
    "Identify the x-coordinates of all points of inflection of the function and justify your answer.",
    "Define a new function based on the original one and determine the intervals on which this new function is decreasing."

  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "How did you use the graph of the derivative to find the function values at specific points?",
    "Can you explain why the function has a point of inflection at the x-coordinates you identified?",
    "What reasoning did you use to determine the intervals on which the new function is decreasing?"
