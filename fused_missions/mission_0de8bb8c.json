  "grade_band": "9-12",
  "subjects": [
    "Algebra",
    "Statistics",
    "Economics"
  ],
  "driving_question": "How can we use hypothesis testing to make inferences about economic behaviors?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will be exploring the concept of hypothesis testing, a method used in statistics to test the validity of a claim or hypothesis about a population parameter. We will be using a real-world scenario involving a pet supply company that sends out coupons via email. The company is interested in knowing whether these coupons are effective in encouraging customers to make a purchase within 30 days of receiving the email. We will be using the principles of hypothesis testing to help the company make this determination.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses for this scenario.",
    "Task 2: Identify the appropriate statistical test for this scenario and explain why it is appropriate.",
    "Task 3: Interpret the results of the statistical test and draw a conclusion."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you understand about the null and alternative hypotheses?",
    "What factors would you consider when choosing a statistical test?",
    "How would you interpret the results of a statistical test?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on the process of hypothesis testing. What did you learn about formulating hypotheses, choosing a statistical test, and interpreting results?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Why did you choose that particular statistical test?",
    "How does the p-value influence your conclusion?",
    "What assumptions are you making in your hypothesis test?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Consider a different scenario where the company is interested in whether customers who receive a $20 coupon are more likely to make a purchase than those who receive a $10 coupon. How would you modify your hypotheses and statistical test for this scenario?",
