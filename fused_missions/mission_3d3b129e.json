  "short_background_context": "The Internet has become an integral part of education, especially with the rise of educational technology (Edtech) apps. However, with this rise comes the challenge of ensuring safety for K12 students. This mission is based on a project funded by the Internet Society Foundation that focuses on the safety benchmarks of Edtech apps. The project involves various research areas such as advertising, contextual advertising, software developer kits, and more. Your mission is to understand these concepts and propose solutions to make the Internet safer for students.",
