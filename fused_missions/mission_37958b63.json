  "driving_question": "How can we use algebraic concepts and economic principles to implement a code word checker?",
  "short_background_context": "In computer science, a code word checker is a program that checks whether a given string meets a set of criteria. This involves understanding and implementing algebraic concepts and logical operations. In the real world, this can be compared to the economic principles of supply and demand where certain conditions need to be met for a transaction to occur. In this mission, you will be tasked to understand the concept of a code word checker and relate it to economic principles.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Understand the concept of a code word checker and its components such as the header, private instance variables, constructors, and the isValid method.",
    "Task 2: Implement a code word checker using algebraic concepts and logical operations.",
    "Task 3: Relate the concept of a code word checker to economic principles of supply and demand. Discuss how the conditions in a code word checker can be compared to the conditions for a transaction in economics."
