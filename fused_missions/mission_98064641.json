  "short_background_context": "In AP Calculus, we often use Taylor polynomials to approximate functions. A Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms. These terms are calculated from the values of the function's derivatives at a single point. In this mission, we'll explore the fourth-degree Taylor polynomial for a function 'f' and a second-degree Taylor polynomial for a function 'g'. We'll also delve into the concept of the Lagrange error bound, which gives an upper limit on the magnitude of the error introduced by using a Taylor polynomial to approximate a function.",
