  "driving_question": "How does a change in stadium affect the average per-game attendance of a team?",
  "short_background_context": "The College Board's AP Statistics 2021 sample question provides an interesting case study. It explores the impact of a team moving to a new stadium on their average per-game attendance. The question is based on the analysis of boxplots, which reveal that the team tended to have a higher average per-game attendance in the new stadium than in the old one. This mission will challenge you to investigate this scenario further, using statistical analysis and economic reasoning.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Analyze the boxplots and describe the difference in attendance between the old and new stadium.",
    "Task 2: Develop a hypothesis explaining why the attendance might be higher in the new stadium.",
    "Task 3: Design a survey or experiment that could test your hypothesis."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What does the boxplot tell you about the attendance in the old and new stadium?",
    "What factors could contribute to a higher attendance in the new stadium?",
    "How might you design a survey or experiment to test your hypothesis?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your analysis and hypothesis. How confident are you in your conclusions and why? What did you learn about the relationship between venue and attendance?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "What does the median value represent in this context? Why is it significant?",
    "Could there be other factors influencing the higher attendance in the new stadium? What might they be?",
    "How would you ensure that your survey or experiment is unbiased and reliable?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by considering other factors that might influence attendance, such as team performance or ticket prices, and incorporating these into their analysis and hypothesis.",
