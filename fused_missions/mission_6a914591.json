    "Algebra",

  ],
  "driving_question": "How can we manipulate and analyze data stored in arrays and ArrayLists in computer science?",
  "short_background_context": "In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by an array index. An ArrayList, on the other hand, is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package. The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array cannot be modified. This mission is based on the AP Computer Science A 2022 Scoring Guidelines, specifically focusing on the Array/ArrayList question. You will be asked to understand, analyze, and create code snippets that manipulate arrays and ArrayLists.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze the given code snippets and understand how they manipulate arrays and ArrayLists.",
    "Create your own code snippet that calculates the average rating of a set of reviews stored in an array.",
    "Create your own code snippet that collects specific comments from a set of reviews stored in an ArrayList."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you know about arrays and ArrayLists in Java?",
    "How would you approach calculating an average from a set of numbers in an array?",
    "What steps would you take to collect specific comments from an ArrayList?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "What did you learn about manipulating arrays and ArrayLists in Java? How can these skills be applied in other programming tasks?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why the size of an array cannot be modified in Java?",
    "What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an array vs an ArrayList?",
    "Can you think of other real-world applications where arrays and ArrayLists could be used?"
