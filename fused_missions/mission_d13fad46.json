  "driving_question": "How does space weather affect the design and operation of satellites?",
  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on a series of space science problems originally distributed to teachers during the 2004-2005 school year by NASA's IMAGE satellite program. The problems provide authentic glimpses into modern engineering issues that arise in designing satellites to work in space. They also offer insight into the basic phenomena of the Sun-Earth system, specifically 'Space Weather'. These problems were designed to be 'one-pagers', compact and engaging, popular among participating teachers.",
