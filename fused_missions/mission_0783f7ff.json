  "short_background_context": "The Tax Foundation, a non-partisan, non-profit research institution, provides an analysis of Senator Bernie Sanders's tax plan. The plan proposes several changes to the tax code, including increased marginal tax rates for all taxpayers, new payroll taxes, and provisions aimed at high-income households. The plan is projected to raise tax revenue by $13.6 trillion over the next decade. However, it is also projected to lead to a 9.5% lower GDP over the long term. This mission will involve analyzing the details of the plan, its projected impacts, and its implications for healthcare.",
