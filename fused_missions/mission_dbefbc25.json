  "short_background_context": "In the modern world, data is being continually produced and it's transforming practices in academic disciplines and professional life. A whole interdisciplinary field of 'data science' has emerged, spawning training programs and new types of jobs. Whether we are fully aware of it or not, data and data science permeate many aspects of our daily lives. The ability to work with, understand, and use data has already become an essential life skill and a requirement for an ever-expanding range of jobs and careers. In this mission, we will explore how data science integrates into various subjects and how it can be used in our everyday lives.",
