  "short_background_context": "Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs, refer to traumatic events during childhood that can have long-term impacts on an individual's health and well-being. The concept of ACEs comes from a landmark study conducted in 1998 by Kaiser Permanente and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study found that ACEs are incredibly common and that the higher the ACE score, the greater the risk for acute and chronic diseases in both children and adults. ACEs and toxic stress are significant public health issues, and primary care physicians can play a major role in improving outcomes for patients by engaging in the screening and management of these areas.",
