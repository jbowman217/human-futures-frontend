  "driving_question": "How can the United States finance a Medicare for All system and what would be the potential economic implications?",
  "short_background_context": "The United States spends more than $3.2 trillion a year on health care, with about 65% of this funding spent on publicly financed health care programs. Despite this, 28 million Americans remain uninsured. Health care spending in the U.S. accounts for nearly 18% of the GDP and is projected to total over 20% in the next decade. The proposed solution to this crisis is a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system. The U.S. pays the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and could save up to $113 billion per year by negotiating lower prices. This mission will explore the potential options for financing this system and the potential economic implications.",
