  "driving_question": "How can we apply concepts from Algebra, Statistics, and Economics to solve complex Geometry problems as seen in the Regents Examination?",
  "short_background_context": "The New York State Education Department conducts the Regents Examination in Geometry, a high-stakes test that assesses students' understanding of geometric concepts. The test includes constructed-response questions, which require students to apply their knowledge to solve problems. The scoring of these questions is rigorous, involving a minimum of three mathematics teachers per student's paper. The scores are then converted to a scale score using a conversion chart provided by the department. In this mission, you will explore some of these constructed-response questions, applying your knowledge of Algebra, Statistics, Economics, and Geometry to solve them.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze a sample constructed-response question from a past Regents Examination in Geometry. Identify the geometric concepts being tested and explain how they relate to concepts from Algebra, Statistics, and Economics.",
    "Create your own constructed-response question that integrates concepts from Algebra, Statistics, Economics, and Geometry. Include a detailed solution and explanation.",
    "Develop a rubric for scoring your constructed-response question. Explain how you would award credit for different methods of solving the problem."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What concepts from Algebra, Statistics, and Economics might be relevant to solving Geometry problems?",
    "What strategies can you use to solve constructed-response questions in Geometry?",
    "How might the scoring process for the Regents Examination influence the way you approach these questions?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your understanding of the interconnectedness of Algebra, Statistics, Economics, and Geometry. How has this mission helped you to see these connections more clearly?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain how you arrived at that solution?",
    "What other methods could you use to solve this problem?",
    "How do you think your approach to this problem would be scored according to the Regents Examination rubric?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by integrating additional mathematical concepts into their constructed-response question, or by developing a more complex scoring rubric.",
