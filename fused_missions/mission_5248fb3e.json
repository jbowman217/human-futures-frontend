  "short_background_context": "In 2013, New York State began administering tests designed to assess student performance in accordance with the instructional shifts and rigor demanded by the new New York State P-12 Learning Standards in Mathematics. The Mathematics test includes multiple-choice questions, short-response questions, and extended-response questions. These questions are designed to assess standard algorithms and conceptual standards, often within the context of real-world applications. They require students to complete multiple steps and apply multiple mathematics skills. This mission is designed to help you analyze and understand the structure and demands of this test.",
