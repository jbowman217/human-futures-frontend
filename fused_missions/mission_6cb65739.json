  "short_background_context": "The University of the State of New York administers the Regents High School Examination in Geometry. The scoring process for this examination is meticulous, involving a minimum of three mathematics teachers per student's answer paper. Each student's total raw score is converted to a scale score using a conversion chart, which changes from one administration to another. The scoring rubrics for the constructed-response questions are designed to provide a systematic, consistent method for awarding credit. This mission will delve into understanding this scoring process and its implications on student performance and learning.",
