  "driving_question": "How can we develop a more comprehensive and accurate measure of economic progress and individual well-being than the GDP?",
  "short_background_context": "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a widely used indicator of a country's economic health and an important tool for economic policy. However, it has been criticized for not accurately reflecting individual well-being or economic progress. There have been calls to replace or refocus GDP with a metric that better reflects the welfare dimension. In response, the U.S. agency responsible for the GDP accounts launched the 'GDP and Beyond' program. This mission will explore the 'Beyond GDP' debate and consider alternative measures of economic progress and individual well-being.",
