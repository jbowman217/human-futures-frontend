  "driving_question": "How can we effectively implement the New York State Learning Standards for Computer Science and Digital Fluency in our high school curriculum?",
  "short_background_context": "In December 2020, the Board of Regents adopted the New York State (NYS) Learning Standards for Computer Science and Digital Fluency. This was the result of a two-year collaborative process involving multiple stakeholders. The goal is to ensure every student knows how to live productively and safely in a technology-dominated world. This includes understanding the essential features of digital technologies, why and how they work, and how to communicate and create using these technologies. The implementation of these standards is spread out over four years, with full implementation expected by September 2024.",
  "tasks": [
    "Research and understand the NYS Learning Standards for Computer Science and Digital Fluency.",
