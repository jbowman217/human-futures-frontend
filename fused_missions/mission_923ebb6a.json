  "driving_question": "How can we apply calculus concepts, such as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Euler's method, to solve real-world problems?",
  "short_background_context": "Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation of quantities. It is a fundamental tool in many areas, including economics, physics, and computer science. In this mission, we will explore the concepts of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Euler's method, which are essential tools in calculus. We will apply these concepts to solve problems and understand their practical applications. By the end of this mission, you should be able to apply these calculus concepts to solve real-world problems and understand their significance in various fields.",
