    "Geometry"
  ],
  "driving_question": "How can we apply mathematical concepts to solve real-world problems and how does project-based learning enhance this process?",
  "short_background_context": "Many students struggle to connect mathematics with their daily lives, often leading to a lack of interest in the subject. However, mathematics is a crucial discipline with numerous practical applications in various fields like agriculture, construction, and industry. Project-based learning offers an effective approach to teaching mathematics by allowing students to apply their knowledge to real-life scenarios. This method has been shown to increase student confidence, enhance their understanding, and stimulate their interest in mathematics.",
  "tasks": [
    "Identify a real-world problem that can be solved using mathematical concepts and develop a project plan to address it.",
    "Use appropriate technology to implement your project, applying relevant mathematical concepts (Algebra, Statistics, Economics, Geometry) to solve the identified problem.",
    "Present your project, explaining how you applied mathematical concepts to solve the problem and discuss the effectiveness of the project-based learning approach."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What are some real-world problems that you think can be solved using mathematical concepts?",
    "How do you think project-based learning might enhance your understanding of mathematics?",
    "What kind of technology could be useful in implementing your project?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on your experience with this project. How has it changed your perception of mathematics? What did you learn about the application of mathematics in real-world scenarios? How effective did you find the project-based learning approach?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain how you applied mathematical concepts to solve the problem?",
    "What challenges did you face during the project and how did you overcome them?",
    "How did the use of technology aid in your project?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students can remix this problem by choosing a different real-world problem to solve or by using different mathematical concepts in their project. They could also explore the use of different technologies in implementing their project.",
