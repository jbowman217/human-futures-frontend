  "short_background_context": "In this mission, you will be exploring two distinct problems. The first problem involves the analysis of two functions, f and g, their properties, and their interactions. You will be asked to find specific values, determine end behavior, and explore the concept of inverse functions. The second problem is a real-world scenario involving the sales of a new video game. You will be asked to create a model to represent the sales, find the average rate of change, estimate sales for a specific day, and explain the limitations of the model.",
