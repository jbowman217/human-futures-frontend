  "grade_band": "9-12",
  "subjects": [
    "Algebra",

  ],
  "driving_question": "How can we use algebra and economics principles to understand and optimize a computer simulation of a frog hopping towards a goal?",
  "short_background_context": "The AP Computer Science A exam often includes free-response questions that require students to understand and write code for a specific scenario. In 2018, one such question involved a simulation of a frog hopping in a straight line towards a goal. The frog could hop a certain maximum number of times, and each hop could move the frog closer to or further from the goal. This mission will use this scenario as a springboard to explore concepts in algebra and economics, such as optimization and cost-benefit analysis.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze the given frog simulation scenario and write the missing 'simulate' and 'runSimulations' methods in Java.",
    "Use algebraic concepts to predict the outcome of the simulation under different conditions (e.g., varying the maximum number of hops or the goal distance).",
    "Apply economic principles to evaluate the cost and benefits of each hop, considering factors such as energy expenditure and likelihood of reaching the goal."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What variables in the frog simulation could be manipulated to change the outcome?",
    "How might you use algebra to model the frog's hopping path?",
    "What economic principles could be relevant to this scenario?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on how you applied algebra and economics to understand and optimize the frog simulation. What did you learn about the intersection of these subjects and computer science?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain how you modeled the frog's path algebraically?",
    "What factors did you consider in your cost-benefit analysis?",
    "How did changing the maximum number of hops or the goal distance affect the outcome of the simulation?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Consider a new scenario where there are multiple frogs with different maximum hops and goal distances. How would you modify the simulation and your analyses to accommodate this complexity?",
