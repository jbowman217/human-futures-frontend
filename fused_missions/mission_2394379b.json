  "driving_question": "How can we apply scoring criteria to solve computer science problems effectively?",
  "short_background_context": "The College Board provides scoring guidelines for AP\u00ae Computer Science A exams. These guidelines detail how points are awarded or deducted based on the student's response to a question. Understanding these guidelines can help students improve their problem-solving skills and perform better on exams. In this mission, we will focus on a specific problem from the 2023 Scoring Guidelines - finding a free block of time in a schedule and making an appointment. We'll explore how the scoring criteria apply to this problem and how to avoid common pitfalls.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Analyze the provided problem and scoring guidelines. Identify the key components of the problem and how points are awarded or deducted.",
    "Task 2: Develop a solution for the problem using the scoring criteria as a guide. Be mindful of common pitfalls that may result in point deductions.",
    "Task 3: Review your solution and apply the scoring criteria to assess your work. Identify areas for improvement and revise your solution as needed."

    "What are the key components of the problem?",
    "How does the scoring criteria apply to this problem?",
    "What common pitfalls should you avoid to maximize your score?"

  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on the process of applying the scoring criteria to your solution. How did this help you improve your problem-solving skills? What did you learn about avoiding common pitfalls?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Consider how you're applying the scoring criteria. Are there any areas where you could lose points?",
    "Think about how you're avoiding common pitfalls. Is there a different approach that could help you avoid these issues?",
    "Reflect on your solution. How does it align with the scoring criteria? What changes could you make to improve your score?"

  "remix_zone": "Students could remix the problem by creating their own computer science problem and corresponding scoring guidelines. They could then exchange problems with a peer and apply the scoring criteria to assess each other's solutions.",
