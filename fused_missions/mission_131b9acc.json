  "short_background_context": "Every year, the State Education Department of New York releases a significant portion of the questions from the state's Mathematics Test. These questions are designed to assess the New York State P\u201312 Next Generation Learning Standards for Mathematics, covering a range of skills and concepts from algebra and geometry to statistics and economics. The test includes multiple-choice questions, as well as one-credit, two-credit, and three-credit constructed-response questions. Understanding these questions and the skills they assess can help students better prepare for the test and understand the state's expectations.",
  "tasks": [
    "Analyze a set of multiple-choice questions from the test and identify the skills and concepts they are designed to assess.",
    "Choose a one-credit, two-credit, and three-credit constructed-response question. For each, identify the steps required to answer the question and the skills and concepts it assesses.",
    "Design your own multiple-choice and constructed-response questions that align with the New York State P\u201312 Next Generation Learning Standards for Mathematics."
