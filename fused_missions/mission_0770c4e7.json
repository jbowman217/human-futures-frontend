  "short_background_context": "The New York State Education Department conducts the Regents Examination in Algebra II, which plays a crucial role in assessing students' understanding of the subject. The exam consists of multiple-choice (MC) and constructed-response (CR) questions, each carrying different credit points. The scoring keys for these questions are provided on the day of the examination. In this mission, we will analyze the pattern of question types and scoring keys from the January 2025 exam to better understand the structure and scoring of the exam, and to predict and prepare for future exams.",
