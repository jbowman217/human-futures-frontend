  "short_background_context": "Every year, the New York State Education Department administers Mathematics Tests for students in grades 3-8. A large portion of these tests are released for review, discussion, and use. The tests are designed to assess the New York State P\u201312 Next Generation Learning Standards for Mathematics, with questions often framed within the context of real-world applications or requiring multiple steps. The questions are linked to more than one standard, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills and concepts. The tests include multiple-choice questions, as well as one, two, and three-credit constructed-response questions, requiring students to complete tasks and show their work.",
