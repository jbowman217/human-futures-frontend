  "driving_question": "How can you apply mathematical concepts to understand and solve problems in computer science?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will explore the 2022 AP Computer Science A Scoring Guidelines. These guidelines provide a detailed understanding of how scoring is done for the AP Computer Science A exam. The guidelines cover a range of topics including methods, control structures, and penalties. Understanding these guidelines is crucial for anyone preparing for the AP Computer Science A exam. The mission will involve applying algebraic concepts to understand and interpret these guidelines.",
  "tasks": [
    "Task 1: Analyze the scoring criteria and identify how the points are awarded.",
    "Task 2: Develop an algebraic expression that represents the scoring criteria.",
    "Task 3: Create a scoring rubric based on the guidelines that can be used to evaluate a computer science problem."
