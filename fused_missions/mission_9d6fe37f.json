  "short_background_context": "The New York State Education Department administers Mathematics Tests every year and releases a significant portion of the questions for review and use. These questions are designed to assess the New York State P\u201312 Next Generation Learning Standards for Mathematics, which include both grade-level standards and the \u201cStandards for Mathematical Practices\u201d. The questions are often framed within the context of real-world applications and require students to complete multiple steps, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills and concepts.",
