  "short_background_context": "This mission is based on the Algebra II Regents Examination from the University of the State of New York. This examination tests a student's understanding and application of algebraic concepts, including algebraic expressions, equations, and functions. The examination is divided into four parts and includes a total of 37 questions. Students are required to utilize the information provided for each question to determine their answers. Diagrams, graphs, charts, and other visual aids may be used to help solve problems. This mission will focus on a selection of problems from the examination that highlight key algebraic concepts.",
