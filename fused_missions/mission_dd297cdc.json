They have developed standards for learning, teaching, and leading in the digital age, which are widely recognized and adopted worldwide. These standards reflect an evolution in the teaching profession and focus on the promise technology has for empowering learning. They provide a roadmap for educators worldwide as they navigate decisions about curriculum, instruction, professional learning, and how to transform pedagogy enabled by the thoughtful, purposeful, and strategic use of technology. In this mission, we will explore how these standards can be applied across various disciplines to empower learners and transform education.",
