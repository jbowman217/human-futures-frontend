  "driving_question": "How can we use calculus to model and understand real-world scenarios such as warming a bottle of milk?",
  "short_background_context": "In this mission, you will be exploring a scenario where a bottle of milk is taken out of a refrigerator and placed in a pan of hot water to be warmed. The temperature of the milk over time is modeled by a differential equation, which is a type of equation used to describe how a quantity changes over time. You will be tasked with understanding this model, making predictions using it, and evaluating its accuracy.",
  "tasks": [
    "Sketch the solution curve for the differential equation modeling the milk's temperature over time.",
    "Use the tangent line to the graph at t=0 to approximate the temperature of the milk after 2 minutes.",
    "Write an expression for the second derivative of M in terms of M and use it to determine whether your approximation from the previous task is an underestimate or overestimate."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What do you know about differential equations?",
    "How can a tangent line to a graph be used to make approximations?",
    "What does the second derivative tell us about a function?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on how your understanding of calculus has deepened through this mission. What new insights have you gained about how calculus can be applied to real-world scenarios?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why the differential equation models the temperature of the milk over time?",
    "Why did you choose that point to draw the tangent line?",
    "What does it mean for the approximation to be an underestimate or overestimate?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Consider a different scenario where the milk is being cooled instead of warmed. How would the differential equation change? How would this affect your tasks?",
