  "short_background_context": "In the world of statistics, hypothesis testing is a critical tool used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. This mission is based on an AP Statistics question that focuses on hypothesis testing, specifically the matched pairs t-test for a mean difference. The scenario involves a medical study comparing the effects of a placebo and omega-3 on irritability scores in patients with a specific medical condition. You will be tasked with formulating null and alternative hypotheses, identifying the appropriate hypothesis test, verifying the conditions for the test, calculating the test statistic and corresponding p-value, and drawing a conclusion based on your findings.",
  "tasks": [
    "Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses for the given scenario.",
