  "driving_question": "How did the practice of redlining in the 20th century impact racial segregation and inequality in U.S. cities, and what were its economic and social implications?",
  "short_background_context": "Redlining was a discriminatory practice that fundamentally shaped U.S. cities in the 20th century. It involved the targeted denial of home mortgages and other financial supports based on presumed risk. This practice was institutionalized by the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation (HOLC) and adopted by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The riskiness of investing in urban neighborhoods was defined based on demographics, infrastructure, housing quality, neighborhood stability, and proximity to amenities or hazards. This mission will explore the origins, impacts, and implications of redlining.",
