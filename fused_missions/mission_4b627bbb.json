  "short_background_context": "In this mission, we will explore the concepts of functions, their properties, and their applications in real-world scenarios. We will be using the AP Precalculus 2024 Scoring Guidelines as a reference. The mission will focus on the graph of the function f on its domain of -3.5 \u2264 x \u2264 3.5 and the function g given by g(x) = 2.916 * 0.7x. We will also explore the concepts of decimal approximation, end behavior of functions, and the mathematical notation of a limit.",
  "tasks": [
    "Calculate the value of h(3) as a decimal approximation, where h is defined by h(x) = g(f(x)).",
    "Find all values of x for which f(x) = 1.",
    "Determine the end behavior of g as x increases without bound, using the mathematical notation of a limit."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What is the relationship between functions f and g?",
    "How can we find the value of x for which f(x) = 1?",
    "What does the end behavior of a function mean and how can we determine it?"

    "Can you explain your steps in finding the value of h(3)?",
    "How did you determine the values of x for which f(x) = 1?",

  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by changing the functions f and g, or by exploring different values of x for which f(x) = 1.",
