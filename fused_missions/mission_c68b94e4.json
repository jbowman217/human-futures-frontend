  "driving_question": "How can we use statistics to make inferences about a population based on a sample?",
  "short_background_context": "You are going to explore a real-world application of statistics: making inferences about a population based on a sample. This is a common practice in many fields, including social sciences, business, and health. You will focus on a specific statistical method: constructing and interpreting a confidence interval. You will use a real AP Statistics question as a basis for your exploration. The question involves determining the proportion of teenagers in the United States who use a video streaming service every day.",
  "tasks": [
    "Identify the appropriate procedure for determining the proportion of all teenagers in the United States who use a video streaming service every day.",
    "Verify the conditions for inference and calculate the values of the endpoints of the confidence interval.",
    "Interpret the confidence interval you calculated in the previous task."

    "What is a confidence interval and why is it important in statistics?",
    "What conditions need to be met for inference to be valid?",

  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you chose that procedure for determining the proportion?",
