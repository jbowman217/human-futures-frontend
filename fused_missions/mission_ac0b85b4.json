  "driving_question": "How can we use statistical measures to understand and interpret the distribution of length of stay in a hospital?",
  "short_background_context": "Statistics is a mathematical science that involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In this mission, we will focus on a real-world scenario: the length of stay of patients in a hospital. We will explore measures of central tendency and dispersion, specifically the five-number summary (minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and maximum) and the concept of outliers. We will also compare two methods of identifying outliers, providing a deeper understanding of how statistics can be applied to real-world data.",
  "tasks": [
    "Calculate the five-number summary of the distribution of length of stay in the hospital.",
    "Identify the outliers using method A (1.5 IQR rule) and method B (2 standard deviations rule).",
    "Justify your findings and explain the implications of these outliers on the overall data analysis."
  ],
  "pre_thinking_prompts": [
    "What is a five-number summary and how is it calculated?",
    "What is an outlier and why is it important in data analysis?",
    "What are the differences between method A and method B of identifying outliers?"
  ],
  "reflection_prompt": "Reflect on the process of calculating the five-number summary and identifying outliers. What did you find challenging and why? How did this mission deepen your understanding of data analysis in statistics?",
  "ai_tutor_prompts": [
    "Can you explain why you chose that number as the median?",
    "Why did you consider this value as an outlier?",
    "How does the presence of outliers affect your interpretation of the data?"
  ],
  "remix_zone": "Students could remix this problem by gathering and analyzing data from a different real-world scenario, such as the distribution of grades in a class or the ages of people in a city.",
