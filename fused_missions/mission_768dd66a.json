  "driving_question": "How does the historical redlining practice in the United States impact current housing instability?",
  "short_background_context": "Redlining was a discriminatory housing policy in the United States in the mid-20th century that denied mortgages to Black households and other communities of color. This policy has been linked to present-day neighborhood poverty and ongoing negative impacts on previously redlined neighborhoods. Policymakers are considering reparative policies to address the effects of these racist housing policies. This mission explores the correlation between historical redlining patterns and current risk of housing instability, using redlining maps and various instability indicators.",
