# 🔗 Chain Reactions and Hidden Rules

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever followed instructions — but didn’t know why they worked?
- What’s the most complicated cause-effect chain you’ve ever seen?
- When are things connected... but not obvious?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What happens when a change passes through multiple layers?
- Can we measure a relationship even if we can’t solve it directly?
- What’s the inverse of your own decisions?

## 🔄 Task 1: Chain Rule Decoder

Choose or build a composite function: f(g(x)). Example:
- Temperature over time inside a car
- Pollution based on traffic based on time of day

Use the chain rule to:
- Break down each layer
- Track how one change flows into another

> 🎯 Make a “flow map” or annotated formula showing cause and nested effect

## 🕳 Task 2: Implicitly Defined Worlds

Given an equation like x² + y² = 25 or xy = 6:
- Solve for dy/dx using implicit differentiation
- Explain what’s happening at a point on the curve

> 🎯 Build a scenario where you *can’t* solve for y easily — and you still need to find how fast y is changing

---

## 🔁 Task 3: Flip the Script

Pick a function and its inverse (if it exists):
- Find the derivative of the inverse using the original
- Graph both and analyze symmetry, slope behavior, and reflection

> 🎯 Write a narrative: how does the inverse reveal something hidden?

---

## 💬 Reflection

- What’s the most invisible relationship you’ve uncovered in this mission?
- When is it okay not to have a clean answer — and still measure change?
- What systems in the world function like this: layered, reversed, or obscured?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Build a story told through a “chain rule” — every cause triggers a nested effect
- Remix a function to reflect injustice — then flip it with its inverse and write the counter-story
- Design a tool that traces hidden relationships in society the way derivatives do in math
