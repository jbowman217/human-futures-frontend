1. When have you experienced a pressure build-up — literal or metaphorical?
2. What does it mean to have a “compliant” system — in the body or in society?
3. Where might a pressure drop save lives or systems?
4. When is smoothness important — and when do spikes matter?
5. What does a model need to tell a useful story?
