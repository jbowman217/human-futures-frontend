# 💉 Pressure Drop

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- What happens when blood can’t flow properly?
- Can electricity help us understand the body?
- What does pressure mean — mathematically and physically?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- How does your heart keep pressure steady between beats?
- What happens when arteries lose their stretch?
- What’s the link between voltage, current, and blood?

## 💡 Task 1: Balloon Heart

Use a sprayer and a balloon to simulate the Windkessel effect.

- Observe sharp vs. smoothed flow
- Sketch the resulting pressure graphs

> 🎯 Compare your system to a healthy vs. rigid artery

---

## ⚡ Task 2: Circuit Simulator

Build or simulate a resistor + capacitor circuit with sinusoidal input.

- Compare input and output voltages
- Link circuit response to aorta compliance

> 🎯 Translate physical parameters into variables (R, C, P, Q)

---

## 🧮 Task 3: Write the Flow

Use or interpret this equation:

C dP/dt + P/R = Q(t)

- What does each term represent?
- What happens when C = 0?

> 🎯 Connect this math to what happens in real human bodies

## 💬 Reflection

- How does modeling change your view of medicine?
- What happens when pressure builds — in blood, in systems, in life?
- Where do you see compliance in society — and where is it missing?

## 🎨 Remix

- Build a public health model showing the “pressure drop” in underfunded communities
- Remix the electrical analogy to represent flow of money, safety, or rights
- Design a diagnostic tool to detect stress in physical or social systems
