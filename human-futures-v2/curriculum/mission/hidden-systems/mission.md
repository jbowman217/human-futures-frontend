# 🔌 Hidden Systems

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever relied on a system you didn’t fully understand?
- What happens when different systems behave the same — even if they look different?
- Can a wire speak for a vein? Can a model speak for a person?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What do circuits and blood flow have in common?
- When are analogies helpful — and when do they break down?
- Who gets left out when we simplify systems?

## ⚡ Task 1: System Swap

Compare:
- A simple electrical circuit (resistor + capacitor)
- A blood vessel system (artery + heart)
- A justice system (input → pressure → outcome)

> 🎯 Identify the analogies: What is current? Pressure? Resistance?

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Build Your Own Analog Model

Choose a social or physical process:
- Information sharing?
- Access to food?
- Emotional regulation?

Sketch or simulate a model using circuit elements:
- Capacitors (store)
- Resistors (slow)
- Switches (gatekeeping)
- Sources (push)

> 🎯 Label each part with what it *means*, not just what it *does*

---

## 💥 Task 3: Where the Model Fails

Every model simplifies. Every system has edge cases.

Choose 1 limitation of your model:
- A type of person or data it doesn’t include
- A behavior it can’t predict
- A value it doesn’t reflect

> 🎯 Rewrite it with that critique in mind — or explain why it should be left out

---

## 💬 Reflection

- What’s the cost of simplification?
- Where do models help — and where do they erase nuance?
- What does it mean to see people as systems?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Build a wearable circuit that tells a story about access or flow
- Create an explainer: “Why Models Miss Me”
- Write a speculative story: “The Algorithm That Tried to Govern Justice Like a Circuit”
