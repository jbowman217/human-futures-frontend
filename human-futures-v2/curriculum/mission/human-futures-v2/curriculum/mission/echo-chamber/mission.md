## 🧩 Task 1: Match the Pairs

Given a list of words, generate all two-word combinations.

> 🎯 Count how many are echoes (same word repeated). What percentage?

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Word Match Audit

Apply your pairing logic to:
- A transcript
- A comments thread
- A song or poem

> 🎯 Highlight repetition — is it artistic, lazy, manipulative, empowering?

---

## ⚙️ Task 3: Remix the Chamber

Design your own message stream or narrative:
- Build one full of repetition
- Build one without any repeated words

> 🎯 Reflect: Which feels more clear? More powerful? More forgettable?

## 💬 Reflection

- What do we lose when we echo too much?
- What do we gain when repetition becomes emphasis?
- Where do you see echo chambers in society — and how could we break them?
