# 🐸 Hops and Hopes

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever tried your best — and still come up short?
- What role does randomness play in success or failure?
- When is a system “fair” even when most fail?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What happens when outcomes depend on chance?
- When should we retry — and when should we redesign?
- Can a system be designed to support more success without removing randomness?

## 🎲 Task 1: Simulate the Hop

Write or explore a simulation where a frog tries to reach a goal by hopping a random distance in each step. Limit its tries.

> 🎯 Track win/loss rates over 100 runs. What’s the success rate?

---

## 🔁 Task 2: Change the System

Now modify:
- Distance range
- Number of hops
- Rules of failure (e.g., reset on negative)

> 🎯 Analyze which changes helped most. Were they about chance — or structure?

---

## ⚖️ Task 3: Apply to the Real World

What real system behaves this way?
- Applying to college?
- Escaping poverty?
- Getting support in school?

> 🎯 Write a short scenario. Where are the “hops”? Where’s the limit? How could the rules shift?

## 💬 Reflection

- Have you ever felt like the frog in this system?
- What’s the role of randomness in real opportunity?
- What would it take to design a system where more frogs succeed?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Build a visual: “Paths that Fail Us”
- Turn your simulation into an interactive metaphor for housing, healthcare, or admissions
- Design a justice-aware frog system: More hops? Fewer setbacks? Less randomness?
