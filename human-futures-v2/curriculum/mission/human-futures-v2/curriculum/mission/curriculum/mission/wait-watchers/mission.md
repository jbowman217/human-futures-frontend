# 📦 Wait Watchers

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever been expected to work “faster” than felt fair?
- What does productivity even mean — and who defines it?
- What happens when systems track performance without context?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What’s the difference between average and acceptable?
- Can a simulation be used to set fair expectations?
- What happens when your “output” doesn’t reflect your effort?

## 📉 Task 1: The Box Simulation

Simulate packing boxes using random times from a dataset: {4, 5, 5, 6, 7} minutes per box.

> 🎯 Run 25 trials of packing 5 boxes. Record total times. Graph the distribution.

---

## ⚖️ Task 2: The Algorithm Decides

An algorithm sets the benchmark: “You should pack 5 boxes in under 27 minutes.”

- How many workers met that in your trials?
- How does it feel to miss the mark if you worked steadily?

> 🎯 Compare actual times to algorithmic standard

---

## 🧩 Task 3: Redesign for Justice

Propose a new standard-setting system:
- Include rest time, training level, or interruptions
- Use statistical variability to justify your range

> 🎯 Defend your model with math and ethics

---

## 💬 Reflection

- When have you been measured by a system that didn’t see you?
- What’s the difference between fast and fair?
- How could performance models respect people?

## 🎨 Remix

- Create a visual: “What My Day Looks Like vs. What the Tracker Sees”
- Build a justice-aware productivity simulator
- Write a short story called: “Packed, Tracked, and Pushed”
