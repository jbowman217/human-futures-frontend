# ☕ Slow Burn

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- How many times have you relied on caffeine to get through the day?
- What happens when systems reward constant productivity but not recovery?
- Can math model your energy — or your exhaustion?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What happens to energy in the body over time?
- How long does caffeine really last?
- What does “half-life” mean in real life — not just chemistry?

## 🧪 Task 1: The First Cup

Model a 200mg dose of caffeine with a half-life of 5 hours.

> 🎯 Write an equation and graph the function. What’s left after 15 hours?

---

## 🕰 Task 2: The Stack

Now simulate:
- A cup at 8am
- Another at 1pm
- A third at 6pm

> 🎯 Model total caffeine in your system over 24 hours. When do levels peak? When do they fall?

---

## 🧠 Task 3: System Remix

Design a function that encourages:
- Recovery between doses
- Lower total caffeine exposure
- Real rest

> 🎯 Model and compare your system to the “stacked” one. Which feels healthier?

## 💬 Reflection

- When does productivity become dependency?
- What systems (school, work, etc.) rely on *your* stimulation?
- What would a sustainable energy model look like?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Graph your week: energy, sleep, caffeine, crash
- Build a campaign: “Half-Life ≠ Whole Self”
- Turn a decay function into a burnout spiral — then flatten the curve
