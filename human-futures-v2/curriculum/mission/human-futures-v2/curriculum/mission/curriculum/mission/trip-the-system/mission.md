# 🚧 Trip the System

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Where do systems block you — physically or metaphorically?
- What happens when paths cross — and when they don’t?
- What’s the math of inclusion and exclusion?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What’s the difference between 0, 1, and 2 solutions in a system?
- How can geometry represent power, access, or restriction?
- When is an intersection a crash — and when is it an opening?

## 🧭 Task 1: Draw the Boundaries

Sketch the circle x² + y² = 16 and the line y = –x + 5.

> 🎯 Find the points of intersection — if any. Interpret their meaning as access points.

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Break the Barrier

Change the line. What slope or y-intercept gives:
- No intersection?
- One tangent point?
- Full crossing?

> 🎯 Analyze how tiny changes create big shifts in access

---

## ⚖️ Task 3: Real-World Intersections

Model a real system with circular protection (e.g., gated zones, exclusion policies) and a line trying to enter.

> 🎯 Build your own equation for both — and describe the math of resistance or permission

---

## 💬 Reflection

- What systems are you trying to enter?
- What are the equations that define you — and what do you intersect with?
- When is an intersection welcome? When is it blocked?

## 🎨 Remix

- Turn a graph of systems into a social metaphor: gates, zones, passes
- Build an “Intersection Rights” poster
- Write a function for someone who breaks through a barrier
