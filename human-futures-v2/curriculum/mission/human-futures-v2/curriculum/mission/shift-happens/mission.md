# ⏱️ Shift Happens

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever arrived too late — or been left out because you were “off schedule”?
- What’s the cost of being out of sync?
- Can you model lag with math?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What delays are built into school, healthcare, or opportunity?
- How do small timing differences create big gaps?
- When is being out of phase an obstacle — or an advantage?

## 🧭 Task 1: Graph the Shift

Create two sinusoidal functions:
- One represents a process starting now
- One represents the same process with a delay

> 🎯 Label the phase shift and explain its meaning

---

## 🕰 Task 2: Systems Out of Sync

Choose two related processes:
- Education + tech access
- Emergency + response time
- Voice + recognition

Model the delay between them. What causes it?

> 🎯 Graph the disconnect

---

## 🔁 Task 3: Shift Toward Justice

Design a way to align the processes:
- Reduce lag
- Make outcomes more predictable
- Support those furthest behind

> 🎯 Rewrite the function with a justice-centered shift

## 💬 Reflection

- What are you waiting on?
- Who’s always “late to the system” — and why?
- How would you change the curve to make access faster?

## 🎨 Remix

- Create a public transit “lag graph”
- Write a short story titled: “Phase-Shifted”
- Build a metaphor using waves, windows, and delays
