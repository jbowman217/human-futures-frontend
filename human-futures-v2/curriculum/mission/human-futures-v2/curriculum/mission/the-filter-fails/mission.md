# 📐 The Filter Fails

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- When has a system told you you “don’t belong”?
- What’s the difference between being included and being seen?
- Can perfect structure still be unjust?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What does it mean to “pass the check”?
- How do we test if something is valid?
- When does validation miss the bigger story?

---

## 🧮 Task 1: Build the Filter

Write code that checks if a grid is a Latin Square:
- Each value appears once per row
- Each value appears once per column

> 🎯 Try to build — and break — valid squares

---

## ⚖️ Task 2: Design a Flawed System

Build a system where:
- Everyone is technically “represented”
- But some roles, values, or outcomes are unequal

> 🎯 Reflect: Did your validation check pass? Did your equity check?

---

## 🔄 Task 3: Fix the Filter

Propose a new validation method:
- What else should a system check for beyond duplication?
- Add weighting, role balance, or emotional equity?

> 🎯 Build a “justice square” — your rules, your data

## 💬 Reflection

- Have you ever passed the test but felt misjudged?
- When does structure create safety — and when does it erase nuance?
- What kinds of systems *look* fair but fail under pressure?

## 🎨 Remix

- Design a validator that asks: “Who isn’t centered?”
- Turn a seating chart into a social grid: map where power sits
- Build a Latin Square of lived experience: diversity isn’t always equity
