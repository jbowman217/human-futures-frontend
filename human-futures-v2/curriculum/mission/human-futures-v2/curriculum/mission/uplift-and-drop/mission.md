# 📈 Uplift & Drop

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Who gets the highs? Who faces the lows?
- What does it mean to live at the “midline”?
- Can we raise the floor — not just the ceiling?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What real-world process goes up and down regularly?
- What systems show large amplitude without support?
- How can math help us see patterns of uplift and collapse?

---

## 📊 Task 1: Model the Range

Choose a system: mood, funding, participation, visibility.

Model it with:
- Amplitude = variation
- Midline = baseline access
- Max/Min = extremes

> 🎯 Graph a sine function with labels for each point

---

## 🧬 Task 2: Change the Baseline

Raise or lower the midline. What happens to:
- Who benefits?
- Who suffers?
- The feel of the graph?

> 🎯 Compare before/after and explain which is more equitable

---

## 🧭 Task 3: Real Systems, Real Swings

Where do you see cycles of uplift and collapse?
- Crisis response?
- Media attention?
- Resource distribution?

> 🎯 Create a graph and annotate its justice implications

---

## 💬 Reflection

- What’s your amplitude right now?
- What’s the midline in your life — and who sets it?
- What would it look like to shrink swings without losing power?

## 🎨 Remix

- Build a visual: “Amplitude ≠ Progress”
- Animate the fall after a social movement's rise
- Create a sound wave representing equity — how would it sound?
