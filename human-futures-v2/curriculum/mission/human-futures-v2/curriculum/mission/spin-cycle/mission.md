# 🌀 Spin Cycle

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- When have you felt stuck in a cycle — at school, at home, in society?
- Can math describe how burnout builds or fades?
- What systems repeat — and what are the hidden costs of those repetitions?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What does a graph of energy vs. time look like for someone in a high-pressure system?
- What changes the period? What raises the baseline?
- Where is the “reset” in a system that keeps spinning?

---

## 🧠 Task 1: Build the Cycle

Create a sine function that represents:
- Energy over a school week
- Stress over a political cycle
- Mood during a 30-day project

> 🎯 Define amplitude, period, and midline clearly

---

## 🔄 Task 2: Interrupt the Pattern

Modify your model:
- Add a weekend
- Insert a break
- Shorten the cycle

> 🎯 What happens to the graph? What happens to the person?

---

## 🧰 Task 3: Design for Recovery

If a system creates burnout, how would you change it?

- Lower the amplitude?
- Raise the midline?
- Add pauses?

> 🎯 Write or draw a redesigned cycle for sustainability

---

## 💬 Reflection

- What cycles are you part of that others might not see?
- When is rest possible — and when is it built into the system?
- What would a humane cycle look like?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Create a “Burnout Graph” for students or workers
- Build a simulation where recovery time is adjustable
- Design a poster: “What Gets Left Out of the Cycle”
