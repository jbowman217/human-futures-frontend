# 🧵 Tension Rising

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- What’s the most “stretched” you’ve ever felt?
- How does stress build — in muscles, people, or systems?
- What breaks — and what bends?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What’s the difference between being elastic and being brittle?
- How does crimp help prevent failure?
- Where’s your own toe region?

---

## ⚙️ Task 1: Stretch the Springs

Create a spring-string system:
- Strings of different lengths crimp the springs
- Stretch the system slowly

> 🎯 Chart the force vs. stretch curve — label the toe and linear regions

---

## 🧮 Task 2: Hooke and Beyond

Use:
σ = F/A and ε = ΔL/L  
Then plot stress vs. strain

> 🎯 Identify when behavior becomes linear — and when it fails

---

## 🧠 Task 3: Microstructure Matters

Explore how small differences (fibril length, crimp) affect macro behavior

> 🎯 Model your own tissue with 2–5 unique fibrils — create your own stress–strain curve

---

## 💬 Reflection

- What small differences build up into big stress in your world?
- When does flexibility protect? When does it delay the break?
- What’s the difference between resilience and being stretched too thin?

## 🎨 Remix

- Make a visual: “The Crimp Saved Me”
- Build a movement metaphor: how do we move without tearing apart?
- Create an explainer called “Why Tension Isn’t Just Physical”
