## Reflection Prompts

1. What surprised you about how AI classifies data?
2. When did your human intuition outperform your AI logic?
3. What would happen if this system made decisions about people? What kinds of harm could occur?
4. How do you see bias in classification in your own life — school, media, or the world?
5. What’s one way you’d change your algorithm to make it more ethical, fair, or accurate?
