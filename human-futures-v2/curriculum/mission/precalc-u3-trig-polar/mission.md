# 🌊 Trigonometry in Motion: The Rhythm of the Universe

Welcome to your mission. This is not just about sine curves — it's about the motion of tides, the swing of pendulums, and the orbits of planets.

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- What comes to mind when you hear “wave”?
- Where have you seen repeating patterns in life?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- How do engineers use trigonometry?
- What does it mean to graph a sound wave?

---

## 🔧 Task 1: Transform That Wave
Use a graphing tool to explore the effect of A, B, C, and D in y = A·sin(B(x-C)) + D.

### Materials
- Graphing calculator or Desmos

---

## 🔧 Task 2: Real-World Wave Modeling
Model a spring’s oscillation or tide levels with sinusoidal functions.

---

## 🔧 Task 3: Polar Graphs & Parametric Paths
Use parametric equations to model a projectile path or rotating wheel.

---

## 💬 Reflection
What patterns did you recognize across trig, polar, and parametric systems?

---

## 🎨 Remix
Redesign the unit to apply to a city’s energy grid, climate model, or musical frequency system.
