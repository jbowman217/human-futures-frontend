## 🌱 Reflection Prompts

1. What’s a moment in your life where you “approached” something but never reached it?
2. How does a limit help us predict or model things we can’t directly observe?
3. Where do you see discontinuity in the world — in systems, stories, or experiences?
4. What does it mean when a function breaks — and what’s the equivalent in society?
5. Where would *you* place a breakpoint to reflect change?
