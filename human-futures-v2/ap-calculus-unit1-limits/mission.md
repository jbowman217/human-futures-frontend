# 🧮 Approaching the Edge

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever approached something but never reached it?
- What does it mean to get “close enough” — in math, in life, in policy?
- What breaks when we hit a limit?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What do limits really mean in real life?
- When does continuity matter — and when does it not?
- What are the consequences of abrupt change?

## 🧠 Task 1: Read the Graph’s Mind

You are given 3 different graphs. Each one:
- Approaches a value (but doesn’t reach it)
- Has a jump, hole, or vertical wall

> 🎯 Identify the limit from each side. Describe what’s happening and how it feels — like approaching traffic, cliff edges, or a hard deadline.

---

## 🌍 Task 2: Continuity in Systems

Use a piecewise function to represent a real-world system with different rules:
- Public transit cost by age
- Speed limit by zone
- Tax rates by income

> 🎯 Analyze: Is this system continuous? Where does it break — and why does that matter?

---

## ⚠️ Task 3: Design a Breakpoint

Create your own function with:
- A jump discontinuity
- A removable discontinuity
- An asymptote

> 🎯 Explain where and why the function “fails” — and what it models. Bonus: connect it to social or physical systems that also break under pressure.

## 💬 Reflection

- What’s the most powerful metaphor for a mathematical limit?
- When is it okay to be discontinuous?
- What do you see differently now about “approaching but never reaching”?

## 🎨 Remix

- Animate a story about approaching a personal or community threshold
- Design a “limit scanner” that flags where systems need to change
- Write a short story titled: “Where the Function Failed”
