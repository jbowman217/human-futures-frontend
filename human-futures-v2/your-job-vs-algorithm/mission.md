# ⚙️ Your Job vs. the Algorithm

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever had a job — or imagined one you’d want?
- What skills do you think a worker needs to succeed?
- Who decides who gets hired or fired?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What happens when AI replaces a human?
- Should an algorithm decide if someone gets a job?
- What if your performance was tracked by a robot?

---

## 🔍 Task 1: Help Wanted

Review 2–3 sample job ads (or real ones). Discuss:
- What skills or behaviors are being measured?
- Could these be judged by AI? How?
- Who might be advantaged or left out?

> 🎯 Goal: Understand what today’s employers value — and how that gets measured

## 🤖 Task 2: Automate Me (or Not)

Split into teams. Each team picks a job (e.g., teacher, delivery driver, nurse, cleaner, coder).

Step 1: List what a person in this job does daily.  
Step 2: Predict what parts *could* be automated.  
Step 3: Decide what *shouldn’t* be — and why.

> 🧠 Challenge: How does AI change what we value in work?

## 🕵️ Task 3: Algorithmic Boss

You’re a worker tracked by an AI system — rating your performance, timing your breaks, and flagging your behavior.

Your job: Write a journal entry or record a short audio message:
- What’s it like to be watched all day?
- Do you feel safe, valued, exhausted, angry?

> 🎯 Add one feature you’d remove from the system — and one you’d keep (if any)

## 💬 Reflection

- Where’s the line between efficiency and control?
- What happens when human workers become data?
- What kind of work *shouldn’t* be automated?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Design an “AI-Free Workplace” badge — what standards would a company have to meet?
- Interview a worker about automation and turn their story into a poem or comic
- Build your own fair-hiring algorithm that prioritizes equity and lived experience
