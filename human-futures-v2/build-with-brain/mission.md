# 🧠 Build with Someone Else’s Brain

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever used a tool that “just worked” — but you didn’t know how?
- What happens when the smartest part of your project isn’t yours?
- Is faster always better?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What’s the difference between *using* AI and *building* it?
- Who owns the intelligence behind the scenes?
- What risks come from outsourcing your thinking?

## 🔧 Task 1: Try an AI-as-a-Service

Explore 1–2 AI APIs. Use them to:
- Convert speech to text
- Detect objects in an image
- Analyze tone or emotion in writing

> 🎯 Your Job: Try a basic demo, document what works — and what doesn’t

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Question the System

Pick one AI service and investigate:
- Who made it?
- What data is it trained on?
- What happens when it makes a mistake?

> 🎯 Present a “Model Profile”: like a human bio, but for a model — strengths, flaws, blind spots

---

## ⚙️ Task 3: Use or Refuse

Design a project that either:
- Uses an external AI API responsibly
**OR**
- Replaces it with a human-powered or transparent alternative

> 🎯 Share your design pitch — what it does, what it avoids, and who benefits

---

## 💬 Reflection

- When should we *not* trust a plug-and-play AI?
- What happens when you can’t see inside the black box?
- What does it mean to *depend* on someone else’s intelligence?

## 🎨 Remix

- Build a parody site: “Outsource Your Life” — click for fake API demos
- Create a visual map of all the brains behind one app you use daily
- Invent an “Ethics Switchboard” for APIs — turn risks on and off
