# ⚡ What’s the Rate?

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever noticed how fast something changes... too late?
- What’s more important — where you are, or how fast you’re moving?
- Is there such a thing as *too much acceleration*?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What’s the difference between speed and change?
- When does it matter more how fast something is changing than what it is?
- What are the consequences of missing a sudden shift?

## 🧮 Task 1: Average vs. Instantaneous

You’re riding a train. You know how far you traveled in 1 hour — but what about your exact speed at minute 23?

- Use graphs and tables to estimate average and instantaneous rates
- Create a narrative: what’s happening *between* the data points?

> 🎯 Your Job: Find where speed matters most — and where it doesn’t

## 📈 Task 2: The Meaning of Slope

Given a graph of f(x), analyze:
- Where the function is steepest
- Where the slope changes signs
- Where the tangent is flat

> 🎯 Now interpret each moment. Is it a moment of action, danger, balance?

## ⚙️ Task 3: Derivative in the Wild

Choose a real-world system:
- Public opinion?
- Disease spread?
- Money in your pocket?

Find or simulate a function that models it. Then:
- Take the derivative
- Interpret it: what does the rate tell you about urgency, opportunity, or loss?

> 🎯 Bonus: Build a “rate meter” — a way to visually track change that people can feel

## 💬 Reflection

- When is it essential to respond quickly — and what happens if we don’t?
- Where do you see derivatives hiding in life?
- What’s something you want to change — and how fast?

## 🎨 Remix

- Animate a short about a system changing too slowly or too fast
- Build a “rate alarm” that triggers when a system’s changing too much
- Create a remix called *Slope Stories: Life on the Curve*
