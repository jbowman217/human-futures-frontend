# 🌍 Eco-AI Solutions Lab

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- What’s a local or global environmental issue you care about?
- Where do you see waste, pollution, or injustice — and what’s being done?
- Can AI actually help save the planet?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- Where is AI already being used for environmental problems?
- What are the limits of “tech for good”?
- Who gets left out when AI “solves” a problem?

## 🌱 Task 1: Investigate AI for the Environment

Explore 2–3 real examples of AI used in environmental efforts. Choose from:
- Wildlife conservation (tracking poachers, endangered species)
- Smart agriculture (sensors + prediction)
- Energy grid optimization
- Pollution mapping or air quality prediction
- Urban design + climate modeling

> 🎯 Your Job: Make a one-slide summary of one system — including what it *helps*, what it *misses*, and who it *affects*

## 🧠 Task 2: Design Your Own Solution

You’re part of an AI-for-Climate startup. Choose an issue:
- Flooding? Trash? Forest fires? Heat islands? Food waste?

Build a concept for an AI-powered solution:
- What data would it need?
- What decisions would it make?
- Who would benefit — and who might be impacted?

> 🎯 Bonus: Use graphics, diagrams, or a pitch deck to present

## 🧪 Task 3: Interrogate Your Own Solution

Before you “launch” your idea, run it through a critique session.

Ask:
- Could it reinforce inequality?
- Who might be excluded by your data or design?
- What happens if it breaks?

> 🎯 Edit your solution based on feedback

---

## 💬 Reflection

- What makes a solution truly sustainable — not just technical?
- How do you balance innovation and inclusion?
- How does your community define environmental justice?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Make a fake ad campaign for a “green” product that fails to deliver
- Remix a corporate AI project into a grassroots version
- Build a student-run Eco-Lab with local data + AI-based ideas
