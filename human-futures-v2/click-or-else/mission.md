# 🔐 Would You Click “Accept”?

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- What’s the last app you installed?
- Did you read the terms of service?
- What do you think that app knows about you now?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- What do we give up for convenience?
- Who benefits most from data collection?
- When is surveillance useful — and when is it dangerous?

## 📱 Task 1: Track Me If You Can

Choose a familiar app or platform. Investigate:
- What data does it collect?
- What permissions does it ask for?
- Can you still use it if you say no?

> 🎯 Your Job: List or sketch everything the app might know about you

---

## 📜 Task 2: Terms of Confusion

Pull up a real terms of service agreement (or use a simplified excerpt).

- Highlight: what’s clear? what’s vague?
- Translate 3 sections into language a 10-year-old could understand
- Ask: would you still agree?

> 🎯 Goal: Decode the real power behind “click to accept”

## 📡 Task 3: Redesign for Consent

You’re now the CEO. Redesign your app or platform with:
- Transparent data practices
- Real opt-outs
- Creative alternatives to tracking

> 🎯 Share your new “terms of service” or “opt-in screen” — present it to the class

## 💬 Reflection

- What trade-offs did you uncover?
- Where do you see consent — and where do you see coercion?
- How would *you* feel knowing your choices train future algorithms?

## 🎨 Remix

- Rewrite the TOS as a rap, comic, or meme
- Invent a “Consent Checker” AI that blocks dark patterns
- Make a PSA: “What You Really Accept When You Click Accept”
