# 💬 Talk Back to the Bot

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever talked to Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant?
- Did it feel like talking to a person? Why or why not?
- What does it mean for an AI to “listen” to you?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- Can a chatbot really understand you?
- Who’s behind the bot’s voice and choices?
- What happens if an AI misinterprets what you say?

## 🤖 Task 1: Talk to Some Bots

Explore 2–3 different chatbots — voice assistants, typing bots, or scripted agents.

Ask:
- What tasks can they do?
- What topics can they talk about?
- Where do they break or get weird?

> 🎯 Make a chart: strengths, weaknesses, tone, clarity

## 🧠 Task 2: Build a Bot Blueprint

Pick a subject area (school, health, community, etc.) and design your own chatbot that could help someone.

Use a tool like Botframe or draw a dialogue tree.

- What does the bot say first?
- What happens if it doesn’t understand?
- What tone does it use — casual, helpful, strict, funny?

> 🎯 Goal: Make it helpful *and* ethical

---

## 🔄 Task 3: What If the Bot Gets It Wrong?

Imagine a situation where the chatbot mishears or misunderstands something important.

- What’s the consequence?
- How should the bot respond?
- How would you *fix* this with a better design?

> 🎯 Bonus: Write a short script where the bot makes a mistake and the user calls it out

## 💬 Reflection

- What makes a chatbot feel “human” — and should it?
- How would you feel if an AI misinterpreted something personal?
- What rights should people have when talking to AI?

## 🎨 Remix

- Redesign a school chatbot that *actually* helps students
- Turn a bad chatbot conversation into a skit or comic
- Write Terms of Use for your own bot — in language a 5th grader could understand
