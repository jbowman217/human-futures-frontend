# 🏥 Beyond the Mean

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever been labeled an outlier?
- What do systems do with people who don’t “fit the curve”?
- Who decides what’s “normal”?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- How do we define fairness in numbers?
- Can averages hide important stories?
- Who benefits when data is simplified?

## 📊 Task 1: Graph the Stays

Analyze a dotplot and frequency table of patient lengths of stay.

- Construct a boxplot
- Calculate the five-number summary
- Identify skew and outliers

> 🎯 What does the graph hide? Who’s at the edge of the curve?

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Two Rules for Outliers

Compare:
- Method A: 1.5 × IQR rule
- Method B: 2-standard deviation rule

> 🎯 Find which points are flagged by each. Discuss: Why might Method A capture more in skewed data?

---

## 💥 Task 3: Systemic Outliers

Think about another system that defines who’s “typical”:
- School absences?
- Housing access?
- Prison sentences?

> 🎯 Model that system’s five-number summary. What would it say about fairness?

---

## 💬 Reflection

- Where do you see yourself in the distribution?
- When is it better to center the median than the mean?
- How should systems treat outliers?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Make a “Justice Boxplot” for a real-world dataset
- Redesign a data story to center the outliers
- Write a letter to a system: “Stop Calling Me an Outlier”
