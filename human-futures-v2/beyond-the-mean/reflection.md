1. What story did your data visualization tell — and what did it leave out?
2. When is being an “outlier” actually a sign of injustice?
3. How do the methods we use shape the people we see?
4. Have you ever been judged by a single number?
5. What kind of data analysis would you design to *protect* outliers?
