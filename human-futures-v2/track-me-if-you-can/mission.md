# 🏃 Track Me If You Can

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Have you ever tracked your steps, sleep, or habits? Who else saw that data?
- What’s the difference between watching yourself and being watched?
- Can data ever fully explain *why* something changes?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- Why do we trust data from machines more than from people?
- What biases can sneak in when we self-report?
- What’s the difference between “statistically significant” and actually true?

## 🧪 Task 1: Journal vs. Tracker

Imagine you're in a health study. You walk every day.

Version A: You write it down.  
Version B: You wear a tracker.

> 🎯 Compare the two: Where could bias creep in? Who might be over- or under-estimated?

## 🧠 Task 2: Significant but Not Causal?

A study finds people who walk more tend to have lower cholesterol.

- The difference is statistically significant.
- But can we say walking caused the improvement?

> 🎯 Debate or write: What else could explain the result? What’s missing?

---

## ⚖️ Task 3: Design the Trial

Plan a 30-day experiment to test walking vs. cholesterol.

- Random assignment?
- What variables would you measure?
- What data is self-reported vs. tracked?

> 🎯 Design a better study — but include trade-offs: cost, privacy, burden

## 💬 Reflection

- Have you ever been misrepresented by your own data?
- Who decides which evidence is valid?
- What would a “fair” health study look like?

## 🎨 Remix

- Build a wearable data ethics policy
- Design a health tracker that centers consent and cultural context
- Remix an ad for a fitness tracker — turn it into a cautionary tale
