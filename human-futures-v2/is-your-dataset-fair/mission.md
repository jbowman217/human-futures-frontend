# 📊 Is Your Dataset Fair?

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- What does it mean to be fair?
- Have you ever made a decision that wasn’t fair to someone else?
- What does "data" mean? Where do we see it?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- Who decides what goes into a dataset?
- Can a robot make a bad decision if it’s trained unfairly?
- What happens when we ask the wrong questions?

## 🔍 Task 1: Draw a Teacher

Draw a picture of a teacher. What do they look like? What are they doing?

Then look at the pictures as a class:
- What do they have in common?
- Are there patterns?
- Do the pictures represent *all* teachers?

> 🎯 Your Job: Look for patterns and possible stereotypes in the drawings.

## 📋 Task 2: Best Games Ever?

Make a list of the “Best Games Ever” based on your own favorites.

Then ask:
- Would this list work for people of all ages?
- What if it was used to buy gifts for the whole school?

> 🎯 Your Job: Rename the list so it’s more fair, and brainstorm better ways to collect data from different people.

## 🐾 Task 3: Choose the Class Pet

Take a survey of your class about what pet they want. Graph the results:
- Bar graph by pet
- Then a stacked graph by age or gender

Then ask:
- Did the survey include everyone?
- What happens if we only ask one group?
- Is that fair?

> 🎯 Your Job: Make a plan to collect more fair data next time — and predict what might change.

## 💬 Reflection

- What did we learn about data and decisions?
- Can AI make good choices if its training data is unfair?
- What would happen if AI made choices about **people** using biased data?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Redesign a “better dataset” for the games or pet survey
- Create a poster that explains bias to another grade
- Invent a “Fairness Scanner” AI — how would it work?
