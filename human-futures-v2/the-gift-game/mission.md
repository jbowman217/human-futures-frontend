## 🎲 Task 1: 52 Weeks of Luck

You and 199 coworkers are in a weekly raffle. Each week, one person wins a gift card.

- What’s the probability YOU win *at least once* in 52 weeks?
- What’s your expected number of wins?

> 🎯 Run a simulation and compare with theory. Share how it *feels*.

## 💡 Task 2: Agatha Never Wins

Agatha didn’t win all year. She says it’s rigged. You say: maybe not?

- Calculate the probability of zero wins in 52 draws.
- Debate: Is her experience enough to reject randomness?

> 🎯 Bonus: Write a “statistical complaint form” from Agatha’s point of view.

## ⚖️ Task 3: Fair Isn’t Always Equal

Design a different reward system:
- Still random?
- Based on participation?
- Cumulative wins?

> 🎯 Compare outcomes. What do people prefer — even if it's *less* random?

## 💬 Reflection

- When do you trust randomness? When do you resist it?
- What does “expected” mean in real life?
- Can a system be fair mathematically and unfair socially?

## 🎨 Remix

- Build a “fairness engine” — a tool that balances randomness and justice
- Make a visual: Probability vs. Perception
- Remix a school lottery, public housing waitlist, or justice system using math
