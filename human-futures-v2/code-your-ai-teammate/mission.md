# 🎮 Code Your AI Teammate

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- Who’s your favorite NPC (non-player character) in a game?
- What makes them helpful, annoying, funny, or unforgettable?
- Can a virtual character be fair, biased, or inclusive?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- How do NPCs “decide” what to do?
- What happens when they misunderstand or mistreat the player?
- How would you design a character who *helps everyone*?

## 🧩 Task 1: Analyze an NPC

Choose an NPC from a game you know or watch on video.

- What does the NPC do?
- When does it fail — or shine?
- Is it scripted or adaptive?

> 🎯 Chart its behavior: If → Then logic, reaction trees, or patterns

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Build Your AI Teammate

Design your own NPC using a decision tree, flowchart, or coding tool.

- Pick a game genre (adventure, sports, puzzle, etc.)
- Define your NPC’s goal (helper, guide, rival, moral compass)
- Design its logic: how does it move, decide, adapt?

> 🎯 Share as a visual map or simple code — Scratch, Pseudocode, or Python

---

## 💥 Task 3: Test, Break, and Reflect

Swap designs with a partner. Try to:
- Predict what their NPC would do in new situations
- “Break” their logic by asking unexpected questions or changing context
- Give feedback: What worked? What failed? Was it fair?

> 🎯 Final step: Add one new feature to improve fairness, empathy, or replayability

## 💬 Reflection

- What does “intelligence” mean in a game?
- How do characters shape player trust, tension, and joy?
- Can a digital character respect you — or make you feel erased?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Create a cultural or justice-driven NPC (e.g., a street medic, resistance artist, land protector)
- Build a nonverbal AI character — how does it communicate?
- Design a "Consent Guardian" that watches out for players’ choices in complex games
