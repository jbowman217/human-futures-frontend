# ⚖️ Code ≠ Constitution

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- What laws protect you — online and offline?
- Who makes the rules for how AI is used?
- What happens when those rules are unclear?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- Can AI systems enforce laws fairly?
- What rights do you have when an algorithm judges you?
- Should code be allowed to make life-changing decisions?

---

## 📜 Task 1: Decode the Rules

Choose a real AI regulation proposal (e.g., facial recognition bans, hiring transparency laws, AI labeling bills).

- Who created it?
- What problem is it trying to solve?
- Who supports or opposes it — and why?

> 🎯 Create a one-slide brief explaining the law and what you think about it

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Law vs. Logic

You’re designing an AI that controls something big: housing access, job interviews, school discipline, or public benefits.

- What rules would it need to follow?
- Who defines “fair”?
- What happens if a rule is written in code — but not law?

> 🎯 Write a test case where the system makes a mistake — and your team has to respond

---

## 🗳 Task 3: AI Bill of Rights

Imagine you’re drafting a “Digital Rights Charter” for people living in an AI-powered society.

Include:
- 3–5 fundamental rights or protections
- Example scenarios where they matter
- A symbol or icon for each right

> 🎯 Present and defend your AI Bill of Rights to the class or community board

---

## 💬 Reflection

- Where does power live in an AI-powered society?
- Can we trust machines to enforce values?
- What rules would *you* want to live under?

---

## 🎨 Remix

- Rewrite a real law to make it AI-proof
- Create a campaign poster for your AI Bill of Rights
- Design a legal case study where a person challenges an algorithm in court
