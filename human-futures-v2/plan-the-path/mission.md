# 🛞 Plan the Path, Dodge the Trap

## 💭 Prethinking Ideas
- What’s the smartest way to get from A to B?
- What happens when a robot hits an obstacle?
- Should AI always take the fastest route?

## ❓ Prethinking Questions
- How do robots “see” the world and make decisions?
- What trade-offs do they make when choosing a path?
- What role should humans play in controlling autonomous systems?

## 🤖 Task 1: Build a Grid World

Create a grid-based map (paper or digital). Include:
- Start and goal points
- Obstacles and traps
- Rules for movement (up/down/left/right)

> 🎯 Your Job: Write a rule-based system to help your robot navigate to the goal

---

## 🧠 Task 2: Add Sensing + AI

Now upgrade:
- Add sensors (vision, proximity, trap detection)
- Create smarter decision logic: avoid traps, minimize moves, optimize energy

> 🎯 Test with 3 scenarios: Easy, Deceptive, Impossible. What worked and what broke?

## 💥 Task 3: Ethical Upgrade

You’ve been hired to design a warehouse or delivery robot. It will move around humans, animals, and fragile goods.

- What safety rules do you build in?
- When does your robot stop or ask for help?
- What trade-offs will it make — and who decides?

> 🎯 Present your logic + diagram + decision tree

## 💬 Reflection

- What’s the difference between smart, fast, and safe?
- Who decides what a robot *should* do?
- When should a robot *stop* and ask a human?

## 🎨 Remix

- Redesign your pathfinding robot for a rescue mission, protest march, or food delivery service in low-light or crisis zones
- Add voice interaction: “Help me decide!” mode for tricky turns
- Create a comic: “I Dodged the Trap — But Should I Have?”
