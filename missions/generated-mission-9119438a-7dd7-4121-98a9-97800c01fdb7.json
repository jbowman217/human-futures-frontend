These odds vary on different factors; however, get a common approximation like 1 in 50 or 1 in 100. Further, explain the concept of geometric distribution and how it applies in this context.",
                "hint": "You can find information on the NYC's official website or other reliable data sources. Geometric distribution logic can be used to model the number of trials needed for a success in a random experiment. In this case, 'success' is getting selected in the lottery."

Explain the concept of 'expected number of attempts' and illustrate with your calculations.",
                "hint": "The expected number of attempts is basically the average number of tries required for a success. In terms of geometric distribution, it's calculated as 1 divided by the probability of success."
